1. WHAT IS OUR POSITION ON THIRD PARTY WEBSITES?<br>
In Short: We are not responsible for the security of any information you share with third parties we may link to or who advertise on our Services but are not affiliated with them. <br>
The Services may link to third party websites, online services or mobile applications and/or contain advertising from third parties that are not affiliated with us and may link to other third party websites, online services or mobile applications. Accordingly, we give no warranty in respect of such third parties and we will not be liable for any loss or damage resulting from the use of such third parties' websites, services or applications. The inclusion of any link to any third party website, service or application does not imply our endorsement. We cannot guarantee the security and confidentiality of any data you provide to third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other websites, services or applications that may be linked to or from the Service. You should review the policies of these third parties and contact them directly to respond to your questions.<br>

2. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES<br>
Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) features or settings that you can activate to report your privacy preferences not to have data about your online browsing activities tracked and collected. At this time, no unified technology standard for DNT signal recognition and implementation has been finalized. Therefore, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking that we must follow in the future is adopted, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.<br>


3. WILL WE UPDATE THIS NOTICE?<br>
We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by a “Revised” update date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it becomes available. If we make material changes to this Privacy Notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to regularly review this Privacy Notice to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.<br>

4. HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?<br>

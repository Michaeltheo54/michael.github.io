							<div id="two">Football, as a sport, is played for fun, relaxation and entertainment. To make it competitive at the professional level, incentives such as money, rewards, recognition and titles have been introduced.

Prizes/trophies can be awarded to an individual player or a team. Some awards are more prestigious than others. It is important to note that the most prestigious awards are being fiercely contested by players, especially the FIFA Golden Ball. However, we will explore some of the most prestigious awards in the beautiful game of football. Sit back, relax and enjoy.<br>
<div></div><br>
1. The Ballon d’Or<br>
The FIFA Ballon d’Or is undoubtedly one of the most prestigious individual awards in football.
In addition to being the most expensive individual award in football, this is also the oldest award in football.<br>
The Ballon d’Or awards the best football player in the world every year.
It was introduced in 1956 by France Football, a French football magazine.<br>
Originally designed by sports journalist Gabriel Hanot, this award was originally awarded only to the best European player in a single season.
This changed in 1995 when players from any country active in European competitions were eligible.<br>
It later became a world prize in 2007. Football journalists were the first to vote, but in 2007 team captains and coaches won the right to vote.
From 2010 to 2015, as part of an agreement with FIFA, the award was temporarily merged with the FIFA World Player of the Year award (established in 1991) and was known as the FIFA Ballon d'Or.<br>
The partnership ended in 2016 and the award moved back to the Ballon d'Or, while FIFA also returned with its own annual award, the Best FIFA Men's Player.
The overall winners of the FIFA Ballon d'Or are considered winners by both awarding bodies.<br>

<div></div><br>
2. FIFA Player of the Year<br>
The FIFA Player of the Year is an award given annually by football's governing body, FIFA, to the best and most outstanding player of the world.
This award was originally created to recognize the FIFA Player of the Year. But merged with France Football's Ballon d'Or in 2010 to become the FIFA Ballon d'Or as part of a six-year partnership.<br>
When the partnership ended in 2016, the FIFA World Player of the Year award (which ran from 1991 to 2009) was reintroduced as the outstanding FIFA men's player award. 
Following this partnership, the men's and women's awards have been integrated into the new FIFA Best Awards.<br>
<div></div><br>
3. Golden Ball<br>
Golden Ball is an award given to the best soccer player in the FIFA World Cup. This is one of the most prestigious individual awards in football.
It is based on a player's overall performance and impact at the World Cup.<br>
The best soccer player must not be on the winning team and must not even have the best stats in the tournament (goals, saves, assists), but certainly must have left his indelible mark through their performance.
In fact, the last Golden Ball awarded to a World Cup winning team was Brazilian striker Romario in the 1994 tournament.<br> 
One factor that adds to the prestige of winning the Ballon d'Or is the fact that a top footballer has very little chance of winning it during his career.<br>
FIFA's technical committee draws up the shortlist for the Golden Ball, which is awarded to the best player in each World Cup final tournament. Media representatives will then choose the winner.
On the other hand, the Silver Ball and the Bronze Ball are awarded to the players who finished second and third respectively in the award voting, as the second and third best performing competitors in the competition. <br>
<div></div><br>
4. European Golden Shoe<br>
The European Golden Shoe - also known as the European Golden Shoe - is an award given each season to the top scorer in all European (first division) leagues in one season.
Originally awarded by L'Équipe magazine, the European Golden Shoe is awarded to the top scorer in all European football leagues (first division). From 1968 to 1991, there was no distinction between European competitions until a scandal involving a Cypriot goalscorer emerged.<br>
In the process, L'Equipe suspended the Golden Boot for five years. Since the 1996-1997 season, European Sports Media has been responsible for distributing prizes using a preferential coefficient for the top leagues.
Previously, the Golden Boot could be divided between several players, but from the 2019-20 season, in the event of a draw, the award will belong to the player who played the least minutes. If the tie persists, assists during the tournament and penalties scored subsequently will be taken into account. Prizes will only be divided if equality is maintained.<br>

5. FIFA Puskas Award<br>
Established by FIFA in 2009, the FIFA Puskas Award is awarded to the football player (male or female) judged to have scored the best or most aesthetically significant goal during the year.
The award is given to the player whose goal is selected by the FIFA Legends jury from a shortlist of three goals that received the highest number of votes from fans registered on FIFA.com during the voting process.<br>

The award is named in honor of Ferenc Puskas, legendary striker for Real Madrid in the late 1950s and 1960s, considered by many to be the most powerful and prolific striker in football that Europe has ever produced.<br>
<div></div><br>
6. FIFA World Coach<br>
FIFA Coach of the Year is an award given annually to football coaches considered to have achieved the best performance in the previous 12 months.
This award was established in 2010 after merging the French Football Golden Ball Award and FIFA World Player of the Year award.<br>
After the merger ended in 2016, this award was replaced by the FIFA Best Football Coach Award.
The selection criteria for this award will be based on the overall performance and behavior of the teams on and off the field.<br>
Initially, votes were decided only by media representatives, coaches and national team captains.
In 2016, the public was also allowed to vote. Each group will have 25% of the total votes.<br>
Many of the most decorated football coaches have won this award. It is certainly one of the highest rewards in football.<br>
<div></div><br>
7. Golden Boy Award<br>
Golden Boy is an award given by sports journalists to a young player who is playing in Europe and is considered the most impressive in a calendar year.
All nominees must be under 21 years of age and playing at the highest level of a European country.<br>
It was created by the Italian sports newspaper Tuttosport in 2003.
Each jury is allowed to nominate five players; The jury will award 10 points to the player he considers the most impressive, 7 points for second, 5 for third, 3 for fourth and 1 point for the fifth most impressive.<br>
<div></div><br>
8. Golden Gloves<br>
The Golden Gloves award is given during the FIFA World Cup to the best goalkeeper of the tournament.<br>
The award was introduced as the Lev Yashin Award in 1994 to honor legendary Soviet goalkeeper Lev Yashin.
It was renamed the Golden Glove in 2010.<br>
German goalkeeper Oliver Kahn remains the only goalkeeper to have won the Golden Glove and the Golden Ball in the same tournament, at the 2002 World Cup.<br>
<div></div><br>
9. UEFA Player of the Year Award<br>
The UEFA Player of the Year Award (formerly known as UEFA European Footballer of the Year) is an award given for the best football player playing for a men's football club in Europe.
Players are judged on their performance in all competitions, domestically and internationally, as well as at club and national team level throughout the season.<br>
It was founded in 2011 with the aim of reviving the European Footballer of the Year award (Ballon d'Or), which was combined with the 2010 FIFA World Player of the Year award to become FIFA Ballon d'Gold.
According to UEFA, the UEFA Footballer of the Year award "recognizes the best player, regardless of nationality, who has played for a football club in the territory of a member association of 'UEFA in the previous season'.<br>
<div></div><br>
10. CAF Footballer of the Year<br>
The CAF Footballer of the Year award – also known as African Footballer of the Year – is awarded annually to the best African football player.<br>
It has been awarded by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) since 1992.
Many African football legends have won this award.

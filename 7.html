Oprah Winfrey  is a multi-billionaire media executive as well as a philanthropist who hosts one of the most popular talk shows in America. 
She is a self-made woman who rose from extreme poverty and climbed the heights of success<br>
But how was she able to attain such heights of success and where did it all start?<br>
She was born on the 29th of January 1954 in Mississippi to a single teenage mother. She was born in extreme poverty and was raised by her single mother and grandmother.  Her father, Vernon Winfrey left her mother soon after her birth, and her mother who was just 18 years old at the time  knew fully well that she couldn't take care of young Oprah without a job. So shen moved to Milwaukee in search of a job. Oprah was then left to stay with her grandmother who raised her for the first 6 years of her life. Oprah faced several issues as a child including poverty, sexual abuse, drugs, and unwanted pregnancy. The level of poverty was so much that she had to wear dresses made out of potatoe sacks. As she was dealing with this, she also had several times when she was sexually abused. The first of which was when her mother left her to stay with her cousin because she was so busy with work in order to pay the bills, and it was this cousin of hers who was 19 years old at the time that eventually abused her.  But it did not stop there, she would later on encounter several instances of sexual abuse due to a lack of parental support and guidance. It was probably as a result of these circumstances that led her into drugs, petty crimes and ultimately an unexpected pregnancy at the age of 14. Unfortunately the baby died soon after birth and it was at this time that she realized that if she continued in that path it would ruin her life, so she decided with the support of her father to turn her life around. But how did it begin? Oprah as a kid, was a gifted child and she developed a desire for learning as well as a passion for speaking. Her grandmother realized her skills and started teaching her how to read when she was just two and a half years old. And as a result Oprah developed a desire for reading and became a lover of it, and by the age of three, could recite Bible verses for the church. At the same time, she had a strong passion for speaking and would even interview her dolls and the birds around her house. Atimes, she would imagine that she was on a stage and the farm animals were her audience and she would enact in front of them. Her grandmother realized her talent for speaking and acting and would always encourage her and it was this  encouragement she got that would motivate Oprah to speak in public. 
She got ahold of the autobiography of Maya Angelou’s “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings”, which made her felt seen in a way she never knew was possible.<br>

This book was a turning point for her. She began to see the power of words and realized that she could use her voice to make a difference in the world and from then on, was determined to succeed. She decided to focus on her education as well as public speaking.<br>
Her family took her to church regularly and from there Oprah found more opportunities to improve her oratory skills by speaking at social gatherings and churches. Within a short while, she became so good at speaking in front of live audiences that she was paid up to $500 for one speech. It was then that Oprah understood the power of speaking and decided that she wanted to be paid to talk. She had a lot of opportunities to develop her skills while living with her father who was very strict. He helped her focus on her studies and provided Oprah with the guidance, support and books needed to improve her skills. He made her learn five new vocabulary words each day and submit book reports every week. So, she became very intelligent and as a result, she became a top student in her school and was known for her brilliant oratory skills. <br>

She was also a member of various clubs like the debate club, the drama club, and the student council. Participating in these clubs improved her oratory skills and as a result she became so skilled in speaking that she secured a full scholarship to study at Tennessee State University by winning a speaking contest.
It was at this university where she developed her strengths in journalism and media, paving the way for more success.<br>

When she was 16 years old, Oprah participated in a beauty contest conducted by Nashville's local radio station, won the contest and was crowned Miss Fire Prevention. When she went to the local radio station to collect the prize, people working at the radio station asked her if she would like to hear her voice on the radio, which she agreed and read a script. Everyone at the radio station was impressed listening to her speak so they offered her a job as a news anchor. Oprah accepted the job and started working part-time while she was still in high school.<br>

Two years later, she got a call from a TV station called the Nashville Columbia Broadcasting System, who wanted to offer her a job, but she declined the offer twice because she was concerned that the job might affect her studies. <br>

But her professor, reminded Oprah that the main reason why people attend college is to get such jobs. She heeded his advice and so when CBS called her the third time, she took the job. This made her become the first African American female co-anchor of the CBS evening news at just 19 years of age<br>

Three years later, she moved to Baltimore to co-anchor the Six 0'Clock news.<br>
Now Oprah was a person who was deeply empathetic to people and as a reporter, she had to report tragic incidents like fire outbreaks or car accidents without displaying her emotions. This was very difficult for her and since she was caring and emotional, she couldn't be unsympathetic to those who were suffering.<br>

When this came to the attention of her boss, he wanted to fire her but since was on a one year job contract he demoted her to be co-anchor on a new local talk show called 'People are Talking.' <br>
In this show, Oprah and her co-anchor Richard Sher interviewed people from all walks of life.
Once Oprah started the interview, she felt a connection to what she was doing and realized that this is what she really wanted to do. She asked the right questions and was not shy about revealing secrets about her personal life. This made her to connect with the female audience easily and as a result, Oprah and Richard's talk show became famous.<br>

After serving for seven years on the talk show, she was hired by the American Broadcasting Company to improve the ratings of its morning talk show. Before Oprah joined the company, its talk show was consistently last in the ratings. Oprah immediately changed the focus of the talk show from traditional women's issues to current controversial issues. <br>

Within months, Oprah's talk show became one of the highest-rated talk shows of America. Because of her empathy towards people, people revealed much more about themselves than they normally would on a talk show and as a result, the show was named the Oprah Winfrey Show<br>

The show aired for 25 years, was a huge success, and it received 47 Daytime Emmy awards.<br>

Oprah then decided to start her own production company, and in 1986, she founded Harpo Productions, Inc. Within two years she acquired the production rights and ownership for The Oprah Winfrey Show from the American Broadcasting Company, and this led to Oprah Winfrey becoming the first woman in history to produce and own her own talk show. 
Oprah also became successful in other fields apart from the media. She has co-starred in a few films under her production banner and was even nominated for an Oscar for the best supporting role for her role as Sofia in Steven Spielberg's movie, 'The Color Purple.'<br>

Because of these heights of success she attained, her net worth amounted to over a billion dollars and she was the world's only black billionaire from 2004 to 2006 as well as the highest-paid television entertainer in the USA.<br> 

In addition, both CNN and Time magazine called her the "World's most powerful woman" and one of the most influential people of the 20th century. She was even voted the greatest woman in America's history in 2005.<br>
The story of Oprah Winfrey is one of inspiration and it proves that anything is achievable and possible with hardwork, persistence and determination. <br>

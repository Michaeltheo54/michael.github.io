								<h3>10 good reasons why you need more sleep</h3>
							</header>

							<div id="two">Getting enough sleep is essential to maintain optimal health and well-being. Like exercise and a balanced diet, sleep can help prevent a range of health problems, including heart disease and depression.
The importance of sleep cannot be overstated. Simply put, sleep (or lack thereof) has a profound effect on your life. At a high level, the amount of sleep you get is directly related to mental health, stress levels, immune system strength, heart health, brain health, inflammation, energy, and weight.<br>
Lack of sleep is linked to many negative health effects, including increased risk of heart disease, depression, weight gain, inflammation and disease.<br>

Although each individual's needs are different, most research suggests you should get 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night for optimal health.
Below are some major reasons why you should get enough sleep as well as the dangers of sleep deprivation.<br>
<div></div><br>
1. Sleep can help you maintain or lose weight.<br>
Believe it or not, the quantity and quality of your sleep can affect your weight. Research has found that there appears to be a correlation between insomnia and weight gain.<br>
The effect of sleep on weight gain is thought to be influenced by many factors, including hormones and motivation to exercise.<br>
For example, sleep deprivation increases ghrelin levels and decreases leptin levels.
These are all hormones that regulate appetite and become imbalanced due to lack of sleep, leading to increased appetite and consequently weight gain.<br>
Ghrelin is the hormone that makes us hungry while leptin makes us feel full. This can make us feel hungry and overeat
This is supported by various studies showing that people who are sleep deprived have more appetite and tend to eat more calories<br>
Don't make mistakes. It's a mistake to think that exercise and diet alone are enough for weight loss or weight maintenance, as important as those things are. Sleep is also an essential part of achieving your ideal weight.
Over the years, several studies have linked obesity and poor sleep habits.<br>
A 2018 study found that people who regularly slept less than seven hours per night were more likely to have a higher body mass index (BMI) and be obese than those who slept more.
Additionally, to compensate for lack of energy, lack of sleep can make you crave foods that are higher in sugar and fat due to their higher calorie content.<br>
Researchers have noted that reduced sleep leads to increased fatigue, which can affect a person's libido or ability to exercise and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
Worse yet, feeling tired after a sleepless night can leave you unmotivated to go to the gym, go for a walk, or do any of the other physical activities you enjoy.<br>
<div></div><br>
2. Sleep improves brain performance<br>
Sleep is important for various aspects of brain activity. Sleep and brain performance are closely linked. The more sleep you get, the more effectively your brain can solve problems and remember things. When your sleep is affected, your mental performance is also affected.<br>

In fact, one study found that sleep deprivation can produce effects similar to alcohol poisoning. If you want to be able to think clearly, solve problems effectively, and have a good memory, getting enough sleep is essential.
Researchers have noted that sleep is linked to several brain functions, including:<br>
1. Memory: Sleep disruptions can affect memory processing and formation.<br>
2. Performance: People's performance at work, school, and other environments is affected by sleep disruption. This includes concentration, emotional responses, decision making, risky behavior and judgment.<br>
3. Cognition: By affecting stress hormones, sleep disruption may affect cognition.
A 2015 study published in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry found that children's sleep habits can directly affect their behavior and academic performance. Indeed, cognition, concentration, productivity and performance are all negatively affected by lack of sleep.<br>
A specific study of overworked doctors is a good example. It found that physicians with moderate, high and very high levels of sleep disorders were 54%, 96% and 97% more likely to report clinically serious medical errors.<br>
Similarly, getting enough sleep can improve academic performance in children, teens and young adults<br>
Finally, good sleep has been shown to improve problem-solving skills and improve performance memory in children and adults.<br>
<div></div><br>
3. Lack of sleep is linked to risk of type 2 diabetes<br>
Many studies show a strong link between chronic lack of sleep and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
There are a number of factors that contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes, including lack of sleep.<br>
It is thought that sleep deprivation can cause physiological changes such as decreased insulin sensitivity, increased inflammation and changes in hunger hormones, as well as behavioral changes such as poor eating, decision making and increased appetite, all of which increase the risk of diabetes.
Sleep deprivation has adverse effects on carbohydrate metabolism and endocrine function. These effects are similar to those observed during normal aging, and sleep deprivation may therefore increase the severity of chronic age-related disorders.<br>
Lack of sleep is linked to a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance, which is when your body cannot use the hormone insulin properly.<br>
Additionally, lack of sleep is associated with a higher risk of obesity, heart disease, and metabolic syndrome. These factors also increase the risk of diabetes<br>
<div></div><br>
4. Sleep can maximize athletic performance<br>
Sleep has been shown to improve athletic performance. Adults need 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night, but recent studies show that athletes may need more.
Sleep is important for athletes and sports people because the body recovers during sleep. Other benefits include: better endurance, more energy, better accuracy and reaction time, faster speed, and better mental performance.<br>
Star athletes Lebron James and Roger Federer sleep about 12 hours every night. Tennis stars Venus Williams and Maria Sharapova try to get at least 10 hours of sleep every night.<br>

Why do these athletes sleep so much? Because they know that sleep is when the body performs many healing and recovery processes. They understand that to maintain optimal athletic performance, they need plenty of sleep.<br>
Many studies have shown that getting enough sleep can improve fine motor skills, reaction time, muscle strength, muscle endurance and problem-solving skills
Additionally, lack of sleep can can increase your risk of injury and decrease your motivation to exercise.<br>
<div></div><br>
5. Sleep reduces the risk of heart disease and stroke<br>
Sleeping less than seven hours per night is linked to an increased risk of heart disease and high blood pressure.
When you think about heart disease and stroke, you probably think about things like diet and exercise. And while these are certainly important, sleep is also an important factor.<br>
High blood pressure is a risk factor for heart disease. Getting enough rest each night allows the body's blood pressure to regulate itself.
A good night's sleep can also reduce the risk of sleep-related problems such as apnea and promote better overall heart health.<br>
Poor sleep quality and duration may increase the risk of developing heart disease.
Additionally, short sleep appears to increase the risk of high blood pressure, especially in people with obstructive sleep apnea - a condition characterized by interrupted breathing during sleep<br>
<div></div><br>
6. Sleep has effects on emotions and social interactions<br>
Sleep is related to human emotional and social intelligence. A person who does not get enough sleep is more likely to have difficulty recognizing the emotions and expressions of others.<br>
When you don't sleep, your relationships suffer. You will obviously be more irritable and may feel angry. But it goes further. As one study observed, a lack of sleep reduces your ability to process human facial emotions, particularly happiness and anger.
This inability to read social cues can make it harder for you to respond appropriately if someone is feeling angry or happy. When you fail to respond appropriately to someone’s feelings, they may become offended, causing a rift in your relationship.<br>
Sleep loss reduces your ability to regulate emotions and interact socially.
When we’re tired, we have a harder time controlling emotional outbursts and our behaviors in front of others. Fatigue can also affect our ability to respond to humor and show empathy.<br>
Additionally, people who are chronically sleep deprived are more likely to withdraw from social events and feel loneliness.<br>
<div></div><br>
7. Poor sleep is linked to depression<br>
There is a clear link between sleep and mental health. As study notes, it has been shown that most patients with depression complain about their sleep quality. Many studies provide results showing a notable relationship between sleep and depression.
The relationship between sleep and mental health has been the subject of research for a long time.<br>
Sleep and mood always go hand in hand. And while there are certainly other factors that contribute to psychosis, lack of sleep only makes things worse. If you have depression or another mental disorder, in addition to talking to your doctor, think about how you can improve your sleep quality.
Sleep disorders can also impair emotional regulation and stability, as well as alter neurological processes, possibly leading to depressive symptoms.<br>
Mental health problems, such as depression, are strongly linked to poor sleep quality and sleep disorders.<br>
<div></div><br>
8. Lack of sleep has been shown to impair immune function.<br>
If your immune system is your body's shield, sleep is one of its sources of energy. When you sleep less, your immune system is weakened, making you more susceptible to illness.
Sleep helps the body repair, regenerate and recover. The immune system is no exception to this relationship. Some studies show that deep sleep is necessary for the body to restore itself and strengthen the immune system.<br>
However, scientists still need to further study the exact mechanism of sleep as it relates to its impact on the body's immune system.
One study found that even a slight lack of sleep reduces the body's natural immune response. In another study, participants were given nose drops containing a cold virus. Participants who slept less than seven hours a night were nearly three times more likely to get sick than those who slept eight or more hours a night.<br>
<div></div><br>
9. Poor sleep is linked to increased inflammation<br>
Insomnia, especially due to sleep disorders, is known to activate inflammatory signaling pathways and lead to higher levels of markers of unwanted inflammation.
Over time, chronic inflammation can cause the development of many chronic diseases, including obesity, heart disease, certain types of cancer, Alzheimer's disease, depression and type 2 diabetes.<br>
Studies have shown that lack of sleep leads to increased gastrointestinal inflammation and even may increase the risk of colon cancer.
Regular, quality sleep can reduce this level of inflammation, leading to a healthier gut and fewer gastrointestinal problems.<br>
<div></div><br>
10. Sleep helps in increasing energy levels<br>
Let's start with the most obvious benefit of a good night's sleep: increased energy levels. When you don't get enough sleep, your energy levels drop, making you tired throughout the day. When you're tired, even simple tasks can become difficult. You are more easily overwhelmed and often feel irritable for no particular reason.
When sleep deprivation occurs, the ability to perform tasks that require additional energy is impaired and the system's ability to overcome impairments caused by sleep loss is impaired. Performing tasks that require effort, including doing schoolwork, preparing meals, pulling over to the side of the road to take a nap, and driving while drowsy, appears to be more difficult with sleep loss.<br>

On the other hand, when you sleep well, you wake up well-rested and full of energy. You are ready to face a new day and have energy for the tasks that await you.

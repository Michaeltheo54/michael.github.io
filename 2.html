								<h3>Everything you need to know on how to grow a YouTube channel</h3>
							</header>
						  <img src="13.jpg" width="50%" height="">
							<div id="two"> 
Starting a YouTube channel is difficult, but growing it to thousands of subscribers, or even millions, is much more difficult to achieve. Some people may wonder whether this is possible. After all, there are more than 37 million YouTube channels online, and of those, only a fraction have more than 1,000 subscribers. So how do you reach them and get more people to follow you?<br>

<div></div><br>
1. Create high-quality videos<br>
Standing out on YouTube is difficult, but anything is possible if you focus on creating unique, high-quality videos. High quality doesn't mean you have the best camera or the best lighting. The best videos come from creators who research their audience and the art of storytelling on YouTube.
This skill can't be learned overnight, but you'll know it's there when you can make your viewer feel something at the end of the video: inspired, motivated, curious, a little tickled . Changing their mood from one state to another means you're having real influence (the kind that gets people to subscribe and turn on notifications).<br>
So how do you achieve this? You can start by finding out what makes a video engaging, for example, hooking viewers with a short, engaging introduction.
Capture your viewer's attention with intermittent patterns, such as text, music, images, and multiple camera angles.<br>

<div></div><br>
2. Optimize your content for search engines to get search results<br>
Did you know that YouTube is the second largest search engine after Google? 
YouTube (like Google) is a search engine and one of the most popular in the world. Creators upload 500 hours of video every minute to YouTube, which represents strong competition. Unless you already have a reach list or a loyal following on Twitter, no one can find your content unless you optimize it for search. YouTube videos often rank at the top of Google search results, and if optimized well, your videos can appear there too. To achieve the best results, we recommend targeting keywords that already contain video results on the search engine results page (SERP).<br>
For example, when you type “skateboarding tricks” into Google search, you will see a list of videos ranked at the top. However, these aren't necessarily the same videos you see when you type the same phrase into the YouTube search engine.<br>
If you want your videos to rank in YouTube and Google search results, we recommend creating content with a high clickthrough rate (CTR). The better your content performs on YouTube, the more likely it is to appear in Google SERPs.<br>

Ideally, you want to target keywords in your profile, video titles, and descriptions to get a lot of monthly searches but with little competition. Easier said than done.
First, use a keyword research tool like Keyword Tool (which is very descriptive) to find keywords with promising search volume. Then, use a tool like TubeBuddy to gauge its estimated competition. Again, you're looking for keywords that have a delicate balance between high search volume and low competition.<br>
When you use the right keywords, you can also appear on Google search pages. That's a lot of free promotion for your channel!<br>
<div></div><br>

3. Design eye-catching thumbnails, intro videos, and banners<br>
The most successful YouTubers will often have a clear visual theme throughout their channel. Everything from the font of the title to the color palette of the thumbnail will contribute to how the channel conveys its mood, which reinforces their recognizable brand as a YouTuber.
There are countless details you can explore when it comes to your channel's visual identity, but first things first:<br>
Make sure your thumbnail represents the content you're creating. If a suitable thumbnail is not automatically generated, you can easily create your own thumbnail. 
You should also create a banner. Your channel link banner, gives visitors an overview of who you are and the type of content you create. Creating a YouTube banner is pretty simple, and you should think about it before directing someone to your page.<br>
Also, create an intro video. A simple introduction video can go a long way. For example, this helps set the tone for your channel and tells people what to expect if they choose to subscribe.<br>
If you want to grow on YouTube, don't underestimate the power of custom thumbnails. Each section is like a colorful billboard advertising the juiciest parts of your video. The more engaging these images are, the more likely viewers are to click on your content.
There are many ways to create beautiful thumbnails, such as:<br>
Use appropriate thumbnail sizes (16:9 aspect ratio, 1280 x 720 pixels)<br>
Take clear, high-resolution photos as background or other elements<br>
Create simple photos and clean frames. design<br>
Use bright, attractive colors<br>
Add text when necessary<br>
Stick to a theme or idea<br>
Create harmony between title and thumbnail<br>
Video thumbnails are probably the key and have the most impact on clicks from your entire YouTube channel. It's the first thing visitors will see when your video appears on their homepage or in search results. Yes, your channel and title are important too, but every user will see your thumbnail first.<br>
If this is the most important factor then you should probably spend quite a bit of time optimizing it. Don't just take a pre-filled screenshot of your video, that's a recipe for mediocrity and obscurity. Instead, spend some time using Canva or Photoshop to create unique custom thumbnails for each video. YouTube's thumbnails can vary in trend and style. The common characteristics are eye-catching visuals and a clear promise of what's to come.<br>
If someone is interested in the thumbnail, they will see the title which you will then want to optimize.<br>
<div></div><br>
4. Experiment with YouTube Shorts and Live Videos<br>
“Shorts,” YouTube's short-form video branch, is featured prominently on the home page.
The platform is particularly committed to changing the way it recommends content, ensuring that longer videos are recommended alongside short films.<br>
In other words, YouTube analyzes the audience watching short videos across all channels. Let's say a particular short video generates large views or engagement. In this case, the platform may recommend long-form content from the same creator!
So what does this mean for your channel growth? Overall, this proves that YouTube Shorts is now the bridge that connects some viewers to your long videos. So by publishing short videos, you actually have a chance to promote the rest of your content!<br>
YouTube Shorts is the platform's answer to the popularity of TikTok and Instagram Reels. Try creating short-form videos for your channel as another branch of native advertising.
You can do this by extracting segments from your most popular videos or adapting the content you create for TikTok for shorts. If a short video engages with its audience, that audience will inform your channel and the rest of your longer videos.<br>
YouTube Shorts is still in its infancy and the platform is working hard to feature it on the homepage and in the app, but don't stop everything you do on the platform.
You can also experience live streaming on YouTube. It's another way to build excitement for a new product launch, announcement, or time-sensitive content. Additionally, with live streaming, you can interact with your audience in real-time, and you can earn through donations in the comments section.<br>
<div></div><br>


5. Promote your videos<br>
Advertising videos on YouTube is not difficult at all, so you must do it to grow your YouTube channel quickly. There are many ways to promote your videos, such as:<br>
Use YouTube cards in your videos to suggest more content on your channel.<br>
Use YouTube end screens to suggest more content to watch at the end of your video.
Paste links to related video content in your content description.<br>
If you're unfamiliar with cards and end screens, the main difference is that one appears in the YouTube video and the other at the end. You can place cards throughout the video to suggest additional content, but end screens are only active for the last 5-20 seconds. If you're using end screens, try to suggest just one video (not two or three) so viewers don't take too long making a decision (and get overwhelmed).<br>
Use all your advertising leverage to grow your YouTube channel's audience. Here are some cross-promotion ideas:
Email: Share your latest videos with your email list.<br>
Social platforms: Post your new YouTube videos to platforms like Facebook and Twitter. You can even drive traffic from your Instagram account or Pinterest pins.<br>
Blog: Embed YouTube videos in your blog posts. If appropriate, dedicate an entire blog post to transcribing, breaking down, or highlighting takeaways from a YouTube video.<br>
Quora: Answer user questions with a paragraph of text and a link to your fuller YouTube video.<br>
<div></div><br>
6. Create a YouTube playlist<br>
When it comes to growing a YouTube channel quickly, many content creators overlook the power of playlists. Many people think of them as “stores” for many videos, but it goes much deeper than that. YouTube playlists bring a sense of order to your channel. They organize your content so it's easier for viewers to browse your videos and find interesting content. Best of all, they encourage people to binge watch your content and spend longer on your channel.
And if you didn't know, videos with high watch times are more likely to be promoted by YouTube's algorithm.<br>
Most YouTube channels ignore the power of playlists. Even some of the best channels don't take the time to curate videos and optimize the experience for visitors.
However, playlists are a great way to encourage your subscribers to follow along, find similar videos, and keep watching them. Create a video series or find videos with similar themes to group into playlists.<br>
The longer users engage with your content, the higher YouTube will rank your channel. YouTube wants users to stay on the platform, and if you want to achieve that, they want to expose your content to more viewers.<br>
<div></div><br>


7. Host YouTube Live Streams<br>
Live streaming helps you connect with your audience through Q&A, interactive games, and more.
But did you know that YouTube promotes live streams heavily? There's a section on the platform dedicated to live videos, and getting featured there might not be as difficult as you think. We've seen streams with modest viewer counts (5,000 or less) featured in the gaming section.<br>
It's also important to note that your live stream doesn't have to be perfect. You can attract a large audience by being friendly, interactive, and engaging.<br>
<div></div><br>
8. Regularly check your YouTube analytics<br>
Seeing how your content is performing and developing ways to improve it is the best way to grow your YouTube channel. This helps you focus on the present and the future in equal measure, which is a good thing.
It all starts with checking your YouTube analytics. For example, many statistics will tell you whether your video has a lackluster intro or a poor ending. You'll even see how quickly people click on your content.<br>
YouTube Analytics is a goldmine of channel information. Here are some stats you should check regularly:<br>
Views: Find out which of your videos are getting the most views: This will tell you what type of content your audience likes .<br>
Video subscribers: See which videos convert viewers into subscribers. Some videos may be nothing short of amazing while others may earn you subscribers for life.<br>
Average watch duration: See which videos attract viewers and which make people bounce within the first 30 seconds. This can tell you a lot about the intro, thumbnail, and video title.<br>
Real-time analytics: See how your content performs in the first 24-48 hours to learn what works and what doesn't. If you tried something new in a video and it didn't work, figure it out quickly before repeating the mistake in the next content.<br>
New viewers vs Returning viewers: Find out if you're getting subscribers to come back and watch the content or if this is a completely new audience. If you're attracting mostly new faces, you may need to create a friendly introduction for both longtime viewers and new visitors.<br>
Traffic source type: Find out where your audience found your videos. Do they see your videos through the search bar, suggested videos, or on their home screen?<br>
<div></div><br>
Here are some of the best metrics to track for overall growth:<br>
YouTube Click-through Rate<br>
YouTube Audience Retention<br>
Recommended Video Traffic<br>
Subscribers earned per video<br>
YouTube Interactions (Comments, Likes, Shares of videos<br>
Percentage of new vs loyal viewers<br>
<div></div><br>

9. Post videos consistently<br>
Everyone talks about consistency on YouTube. But that's because it can actually determine your opinions, your followers, and your engagement levels. After all, it's hard to grow your channel if you're not there regularly.
To stay on track, make sure you have a solid YouTube upload schedule. So stick with it.<br>
There's no proven cadence that will skyrocket your audience or subscribers—you just need to find the consistency that works for you and your audience.
For example, successful channels like GaryVee post new content every day, while our previous example, Matthew Beem, only posts once a week. Neither is better than the other, but both are consistent. Established YouTubers often stick to a schedule, giving subscribers something to look forward to. You should set this up as soon as possible because the YouTube algorithm doesn't tend to work its magic until you have about 35 videos in the bank.<br>
Find the speed that's right for you. Think long term. You may have enough bandwidth now to publish new content twice a week, but will you have enough bandwidth next month? And next year?
Stick to a schedule that allows you to create content comfortably. You don't want to struggle every day or weekend to edit and publish your videos to stick to your plan. Creating a content calendar keeps you moving forward so you don't have to worry about deadlines.<br>
<div></div><br>

10. Make sure you respond to people<br>
It's always good to respond to viewer questions, compliments, and criticism, no matter how popular your channel is.
YouTube's internal data clearly shows that encouraging audience participation can lead to larger fan bases. Make it a habit once you start and keep it up. Viewers who feel heard and appreciated by creators are more likely to subscribe.<br>
<div></div><br>
11. Keep your content structured<br>
It might seem obvious, but keeping your content organized and sticking to a specific format will give you the level of consistency needed to grow a channel. Even if the delivery of your actual content is ramshackle and chaotic, its presentation on your channel should be clear, following a formula that potential subscribers can familiarize themselves with.
For example, professional photographer and cinematographer Peter McKinnon hosts various content strands on his YouTube channel, split into playlists. Each playlist acts as its own defined zone: his shorts all follow the same pattern when it comes to their titles, alongside a more social media-friendly aspect ratio.<br>
<div></div><br>

12. Use music to create a mood<br>
Using music creatively and consistently allows viewers to experience your content the way you want, keeping them immersed in your video. It makes a difference: after all, bad audio kills a good video.
The right background music for your content will help potential subscribers know that you're serious about creating a complete experience. However, finding and using third-party music can be a bit complicated. If you use copyrighted music without the rights to do so, the song owner can actually monetize your video by serving ads on it.<br>
You don't want that. As you get more subscribers on YouTube and discover your channel's identity, you should manage your channel on your terms; Finding the right music for a soundtrack can be difficult due to the complexities of music licensing and copyright for beginners – and pros alike.<br>
<div></div><br>

13. Identify your follower magnets<br>
In a perfect world, new viewers would discover you through your most popular videos. You can help guide them with lead magnets: that is, the piece of content that converts the most people from viewers to subscribers. You can do this simply on YouTube Studio:
Sign in to YouTube Studio and in the left menu, click “Analytics”.<br>
Identify your best-performing videos in terms of conversions. You can determine how many viewers were directly prompted to subscribe to each video within a specific date range, which will give you a clear idea of ​​which videos are most successful.<br>
This video is your “subscriber magnet,” so start using it! Consider featuring this video as a trailer for your channel, as the centerpiece of your main playlist, or as the main attraction on your bottom screen. This video is the reason people subscribe, so use it to your advantage!<br>
<div></div><br>

14. Ask viewers directly to subscribe<br>
This may seem obvious, but it's always helpful to directly ask people to subscribe. There's no need to be too catchy if that's not your style - just tell people they can subscribe to all the cool content you have planned and that you have a content catalog interesting that they can refer to while waiting.
Some creators place subscriber tags at the end of their videos, but this is not required. Some choose the middle, the beginning or a combination - play around and see what works for you!<br>
<div></div><br>
15. Use captions to ensure your channel is accessible and inclusive.<br>
The key to attracting subscribers is user experience. In addition to making your channel look "cool," you can also make your channel more accessible and inclusive with relative ease, giving viewers the confidence to subscribe and watch your content regularly. 
Example: Adding subtitles to your videos means your content ranks higher in YouTube's algorithm. Plus, it's also a simple and thoughtful thing you can do to help people and make your channel more inclusive, even if it's for YouTube's large non-English speaking audience, deaf people or other cases.<br>
According to research by Digital Discovery, when you add subtitles to your YouTube videos, views increase by 13.48% in the first two weeks. At the same time, people tend to watch videos longer and engagement increases.<br>
<div></div><br>

16. Avoid posting selfish content<br>
You might want to stream games, host pranks, become a travel blogger, or something else. That's great, but it has to be for someone else, not yourself.
YouTube is the second largest search engine in the world and 65% of people use it to solve a problem. So if you're not educating them, you need to make sure that what you're doing is valuable enough for people to sign up.<br>
<div></div><br>

17. Avoid takedowns and copyright issues<br>
When you distribute content and collect all of it, it's easy to violate copyright rules. Whether it's pictures, videos or music, YouTubers risk being taken down if their content violates copyright – not a good idea for anyone looking to attract more viewers on YouTube.<br>
<div></div><br>

18. Optimize your profile<br>
Once you know which keywords you want to target, it's time to optimize your profile. This will involve filling out your data fields and including keywords in the right places.
For example, you might want to add an important keyword to your YouTube channel name. If you're planning to create a YouTube channel around SEO (search engine optimization) tips, having a channel called "SEO Guru" instead of "Kyle's Channel" will give you a significant boost in search results.<br>
Complete your “About Us” section. Add any relevant keywords you can, especially in the first 48 characters (as they will be shown in YouTube search results). In addition to search value, your profile page is a good place to let new visitors know who you are. Don't expect them to look through all of your videos to see what you have to offer – tell them exactly what they can find on your channel.<br>
<div></div><br>

19. Publish videos at the best time<br>
There is no single best time to publish on YouTube for all videos and all audiences. YouTube is a global platform, and what's best for your tech content may be the complete opposite for the gaming world. I recommend testing different times and checking your YouTube analytics to measure engagement.
However, if you need a starting point to find the best time to post on YouTube, data from Frederator Networks shows that Thursday and Friday are the best days, with 3 p.m. leading to highest interaction. Unlike most social media platforms, YouTube's suggested videos don't appear on traditional feeds. So you don't have to publish them seconds or minutes before your audience hits the website.<br>
<div></div><br>

20. Convert viewers to subscribers<br>
Viewers watch your content and leave – subscribers keep coming back for more. Do everything you can to ensure that viewers subscribe to your channel once before leaving the site and potentially never returning to your channel. Sometimes viewers don't subscribe the first time they interact with your content. Usually, he'll need to interact with a few different videos before he feels confident adding you to his list of subscribed channels.
Don't expect viewers to subscribe: ask and remind them to do so. Add calls to action (CTA) at the beginning, middle, and end of your video to ask viewers to subscribe. Also include the call to action in your description. When you take the time to answer questions, remind the community in the comments to subscribe to be notified every time you post new content.<br>
<div></div><br>

21. Produce Video Series<br>
If possible, create video content related to past and future videos. You want to be able to direct users to your own YouTube channel to see additional content instead of sending them elsewhere. This is best done as a video series (which you can insert into a playlist).
For example, if you're starting a YouTube channel about running, you might start with a "Getting Started" video series that covers everything from buying the right shoes to creating a basic level running program . You can then include a series of videos aimed at intermediate runners to help runners beat their current marathon or 10K records. This can include multiple videos on pacing strategies, nutrition tips, and advanced workout tactics. The video series will encourage viewers to watch more of your content, which will increase your YouTube rankings and your chances of converting into subscribers.<br>
<div></div><br>
22. Write compelling YouTube titles and descriptions<br>
Once you've hooked viewers with your thumbnail, it's time to entice them to click and watch with your title. Like a high-performing blog title, it should be catchy and provide search value. The more people click on your video, the more YouTube will recommend it on landing pages, search results, and related videos.
Avoid clickbait and focus on creating value. Answer potential viewers' questions.<br>
Will they entertain themselves, learn a valuable new skill or keep up with the latest news? Your headline should tell them why they should watch your video instead of the dozens (or hundreds) of other options right in front of them.<br>
Is your video the most complete? Can he educate viewers as quickly as possible? Is this the most up to date? These are the questions that will cross a viewer's mind in the few milliseconds between seeing a video's thumbnail and title until finally clicking on a question.<br>
In addition to value, include relevant keywords in your title so YouTube knows what your video is about and where to include it in search results. Find the delicate combination of being smart, adding keywords, and providing value. It's easier said than done, but there's no exact formula for success: you'll have to experiment and see what works best for your channel and audience.<br>
With YouTube titles, you want to get into the habit of writing emotionally, not just to describe the video. This is important because viewers are not only interested in the “topic” being covered. Many videos on YouTube cover the same topic; The real question is: why should people care about a particular video?
The answer is again emotion. A good title taps into the viewer's deepest fears and desires. It promises to change your life in 30 days with a new workout routine or scare you into withdrawing all your money from the stock market. No matter what, a catchy title will make you want to click on it.<br>
And once you have a good title, focus on the video description. There are no tricks here, at least you just need to describe the video correctly.<br>
<div></div><br>

23. Use hashtags to increase your reach<br>
Adding hashtags to your YouTube video will help more people discover it, so tagging your content is always a good idea. Like most social media sites, YouTube hashtags are 100% clickable. This means a viewer can tap on any hashtag and end up on a page showing thousands of videos related to a topic.
As you can imagine, getting featured on a hashtag page will give your channel more exposure! If you take the time to research the best hashtag pages – ones that are popular but don't have millions of videos – you can grow your YouTube channel by attracting more clicks.<br>
When you're ready, navigate to your video title or description. Enter the # symbol followed by the description of your choice.<br>
<div></div><br>
24. Boost your engagement with calls to action<br>
Every (and we mean every) video needs a call to action. Tell your audience exactly what to do with your content when they watch your video. Call to actions can include getting your audience to take action which will engage them, keep the YouTube algorithm in your favor, and can even lead to direct sales. Don't let this opportunity pass by.
It would be great if most of the viewers; Subscribed to your channel? Hit the like button? Watched multiple videos in a row? Wrote a positive review?<br>
All this engagement leads to channel growth, but most viewers don't think about taking these actions. After all, they are too busy watching videos and discovering new content! To continue growing your fan base, ask viewers to like, comment, and subscribe at the end of each video.<br>
<div></div><br>
25. Build strong relationships with your audience<br>
It's hard to grow your channel if you're not connecting with your viewers, so always find time to socialize on YouTube. You can start by responding to video comments or take it to the next level by hosting a live Q&A. Creating polls in the YouTube Community tab will also help you learn about your viewers' interests, preferences, and behavior.<br>
Engaging with your audience isn't too different from hanging out with a friend. All you have to do is get to know who they are.<br>
Speaking of comments—thats’ where you need to be. Turn on your comments and engage with your community. In the early days before your YouTube channel takes off, enjoy being able to respond individually to each and every comment. Once your channel gets popular, you won’t have that luxury anymore.
Depending on the nature of your content, viewers will sometimes proactively visit comments to interact with you or ask questions. Other times (and especially in the beginning), you may need to ask viewers questions in the video or description to get them engaged.<br>
Ideally, you want your comments to become a community. Users will start interacting with each other and you will become less of a tie-in and more of an addition to the conversation. Once you've built an engaged audience, start connecting with them in the Community tab with regular posts and channel updates.<br>
<div></div><br>

26. Invest in YouTube Collaboration<br>
Find other channels to collaborate on. Not only does this help you create better content, but it also allows you to introduce your channel to new audiences: it's a win-win situation for creators and viewers.
Collaborating on YouTube is a great way to grow your channel by introducing your content to new viewers. But of course, not all collaborations are successful. You need to find the right partners, make sure your audiences overlap, and do other things to make the project work.<br>
Take Matthew Beem for example. Through his viral collaborations with YouTube's biggest stars, he has built a huge following in a very short period of time. He creates stunning content for artists like MrBeast, Logan Paul, KSI and many more, and they in turn share his creations with millions of people
Here are some ways for the best collaborations on YouTube:<br>
Collaborate with creators in your industry.<br>
Think about video ideas before reaching out to your colleagues.<br>
Choose the video collaboration style (in-person, remote, video takeover, etc.).<br>
Foster collaboration to increase reach.<br>
<div></div><br>
27. Take advantage of YouTube Trends and Challenges<br>
To accelerate your channel growth, why not join a YouTube Challenge or some social media trends? This approach is suitable for small YouTube creators, especially those who want to scale as soon as possible.<br>
However, be careful when choosing different trends to start with. Some content won't fit your channel's focus, making it difficult to convert casual viewers into dedicated subscribers.</div>

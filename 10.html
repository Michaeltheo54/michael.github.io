							<div id="two"> 
Eating a healthy, balanced diet can help many people control diabetes symptoms and reduce the risk of complications. A person may wonder what foods to avoid if they have diabetes.<br>
Different foods provide each of the major macronutrients that give us energy: carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. There are more or less healthy varieties of each of these foods.<br>
Most foods can be part of your diet when you have diabetes, but eating some while limiting others can help maintain healthy blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of other chronic diseases.<br>
Some foods and drinks can increase blood sugar and insulin levels and promote inflammation. These effects may increase the risk of prediabetes and diabetes.
Prediabetes and diabetes can increase the risk of other chronic diseases, including heart disease, kidney disease, and blindness.<br>
Diabetes interferes with the ability to process blood sugar, also called blood sugar.
Diabetes may be a disease characterized by insulin resistance and abnormal glucose metabolism, but it also involves protein and fat metabolism. So for people with diabetes or those looking to prevent the disease, you shouldn't just monitor your blood sugar levels. Protein and fat also play an important role.<br>
To some extent, the advice is similar to what nutritionists give everyone: eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, nuts and seeds, and avoid processed foods. 
Most people know some of the characteristics of a healthy diet: eat fruits and vegetables, avoid soda and fast food.<br>
But it's more complicated than that. Understanding how diabetes develops can help supplement these recommendations and bust some misconceptions.
The first problem concerns weight. Although being overweight increases your risk of diabetes, a good diet is probably just as important. Regardless of weight, diet has a big impact.<br>
Secondly, it's not just about glucose. Foods that cause high blood sugar levels will increase the amount of insulin released into the blood, in the long term increasing the risk of diabetes and making the disease more difficult to control.
<div></div><br>
So what is glucose?<br>
1. Refined starches, also known as complex carbohydrates, are chains of glucose molecules and have long been known to cause rapid increases in blood sugar levels. These include white rice, white bread and potatoes.<br>
2. Added sugar, a simple carbohydrate, is also known to cause diabetes because it contains 50% glucose.<br>
Fructose, which makes up the remaining 50%, has virtually no effect on blood sugar or insulin levels - but recent research has shown that it also has a role in diabetes.
Fructose is good when consumed in low doses in digested foods. But in large doses, such as in foods or drinks high in sugar, the liver makes more fat.<br>
Weight gained from eating fatty foods will accumulate under the skin, causing swelling in the cheeks, arms and thighs. But weight gain from fat secreted by the liver is even more dangerous, accumulating around the liver and other organs in the abdomen and significantly increasing the risk of diabetes as well as heart disease,<br>
<div></div><br>
Protein and diabetes<br>
Too much protein circulates in the blood, increasing insulin levels and turning into fat, as does too much starch or sugar.
Eating more protein alone does not help build muscle. So unless a person is participating in a major bodybuilding program, they do not need protein shakes or smoothies and should generally avoid excess protein.<br>
Protein in red meat is harmful in other ways. The iron that gives red meat its color can damage the pancreas if not consumed in moderation and increase the risk of diabetes.<br>
Although too much animal protein can promote diabetes, completely avoiding animal products is not necessarily a good practice
You may have a vegan diet eating mainly foods like rice cakes and highly processed cereals and breads, which will increase blood sugar and cause the liver to produce new fat<br>
On average, the two biggest dietary risk factors for developing diabetes are eating too many refined grains and too few whole grains<br>
<div></div><br>
Carbohydrates and diabetes<br>
Carbohydrates, proteins and fats as nutrients provide your body with energy and help it perform essential functions. In particular, carbohydrates are your body's main source of energy.
Carbohydrates come in many forms, including starch, sugar, and fiber. All carbohydrates except fiber are broken down into glucose in your body.<br>
Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, helps transport glucose from the blood to the body's cells, where it can be used for energy.
However, when you have type 2 diabetes, which accounts for 90 to 95 percent of diabetes cases, your body cannot effectively remove glucose from your blood. This leads to high blood sugar.<br>
High blood sugar causes your pancreas to produce more insulin. Over time, your pancreas may wear out and produce less insulin.
If you have diabetes, you should pay close attention to what you eat, especially the type and amount of carbohydrates you consume, to help control your blood sugar levels.<br>
This will also prevent sudden increases and decreases in blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of long-term complications.
A diabetes diet can include most foods, but people may need smaller portions. That said, some foods from each food group may be better than others.<br>
Below, we explore foods that people with diabetes or at risk of diabetes may want to limit or avoid. We also offer some suggestions for developing a healthy diabetes diet plan.<br>
<div></div><br>
Which food is best for diabetics?<br>
1. Protein-rich foods<br>
For omnivores, the goal is to choose healthier animal proteins as well as dairy and plant-based alternatives.<br>
Healthier Animal Protein<br>
A person should choose the leanest options available. These may include: skinless chicken or turkey, fatty cuts of beef, roasts or chops, fish, especially those rich in fatty acids omega-3s, such as albacore tuna, herring or salmon, and whole eggs<br>
Plant-based protein<br>
When considering plant-based protein sources, check the amount of fat and carbohydrates each option contains. A person can choose: beans, lentils, nuts, soy products, tofu.<br>
Dairy products<br>
Dairy products are a source of protein. They also provide calcium and important vitamins. But dairy products also contain a sugar called lactose.
A person with diabetes can consume dairy products, as long as they account for carbohydrates in their daily plan.<br>
Type 1 and type 2 diabetes also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes often occurs with obesity. For this reason, it's best to choose low-fat dairy products with no added sugar.
Options may include: plain yogurt without added sugar, low-fat or full-fat cheese in moderate portions, cottage cheese, milk, non-dairy milk alternative, plant-based milk, such as soy, rice, coconut, almond, or oat milk, are healthy choices, but people should choose unsweetened plant-based milk.<br>
It is important to note that the most recent dietary guidelines only consider fortified soy milk as equivalent to dairy products, in terms of nutritional content. This includes protein levels.
But you should also remember that with the exception of oat milk and hazelnut milk, plant milk is less sweet than cow's milk.<br>
Eating lean protein can help keep you full and provide vital energy to your muscles. You can eat all lean meats, including lean beef, pork and poultry, as well as fish and plant-based protein sources.<br>
<div></div><br>
2. Fruits and vegetables<br>
Fruits contain high-quality carbohydrates and fiber, as do nuts and legumes, such as beans, peas and lentils. These foods can help slow glucose absorption.
A person can choose from: whole fresh fruit, raw non-starchy vegetables, steamed, grilled or broiled, frozen or canned vegetables, as long as they are unsalted or low in sodium, canned fruit or frozen without added sugar, and unsweetened applesauce<br><br>
<div></div><br>
3. Fats to eat<br>
Monounsaturated fats<br>
They are found in many healthy oils, nuts and fruits, including: peanuts, peanut butter and peanut oil, nuts and other nut butters, such as cashew, almond and almond butter, olive and olive oil, canola oil, avocado, sunflower oil<br>
Polyunsaturated fats<br>
This substance also exists in some oils and nuts and other foods. Two types of polyunsaturated fats, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, are especially healthy.<br>
Food sources include: fish such as salmon, tuna, herring or mackerel, nuts such as walnuts, flaxseeds and flax oil, and eggs.<br>
<div></div><br>
4. Drinks<br>
It's also important for people with diabetes or at risk to watch what they drink. Many soft drinks and juices contain added carbohydrates and sugar.<br>
Of course, a person with diabetes can safely consume unsweetened tea, coffee and zero-calorie drinks as well as water. To add flavor to your water, try adding whole pieces of fruit.
Alcoholic beverages may also contain sugar and carbohydrates. People should limit their consumption of alcoholic beverages, especially beer and drinks containing fruit.<br>
Another reason why excessive alcohol consumption is harmful is that combining it with diabetes medications can lead to hypoglycemia. Symptoms are similar to poisoning and can be difficult to recognize.
Your body needs fats, so including them in your diet is essential. Olive oil and avocados are examples of healthy fat sources.<br>
<div></div><br>
							  5. Sugar-free drinks<br>
You don't need to drink a lot of water if you have prediabetes or diabetes. You can drink tea or coffee if it does not contain sugar. Coffee is linked to several health benefits, including a reduced risk of diabetes.
Choose plain coffee or low-sugar flavors to help keep your blood sugar at target levels and avoid weight gain.<br>
You can also drink sugar-free flavored sparkling water or sugar-free drinks.<br>
<div></div><br>
							  6. Foods that support a healthy balance of bacteria in your gut<br>
Foods that support a diversity of healthy gut bacteria will improve metabolism and thus prevent or help control diabetes. These foods include: Vegetables, fruits, high-fiber foods like beans and whole grains, fermented foods, including cheese and yogurt<br>
<div></div><br>
							  7. Whole grains and fiber<br>
You may not be able to absorb all the carbs from whole grains. And the substances it absorbs enter the bloodstream more slowly than processed carbohydrates. For this reason, carbohydrates from whole grains are less likely to cause blood sugar spikes.
Whole grains contain fiber. Although fiber is technically a carbohydrate, it does not break down into glucose in the body and does not add calories. Fiber is a healthy carbohydrate.<br>
<div></div><br>
							  8. Foods rich in fiber<br>
Providing enough fiber can help you feel full longer and avoid fatigue when eating sugary foods. Many high-fiber foods also have a low glycemic index (GI). Examples include non-starchy vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.<br>
<div></div><br>
What foods should diabetics avoid?<br>
Limiting certain foods and drinks can help you control your condition and reduce your risk of complications.<br>

							  1. Sugar<br>
Sweet foods contain mainly sugar and poor quality carbohydrates. They often have little or no nutritional value and can cause blood sugar levels to spike. Sugar can also contribute to weight gain and the risk of heart disease and stroke.
Foods commonly high in sugar include baked goods, such as doughnuts, cakes and cookies, as well as pizza dough. <br>
Many pre-made products in grocery stores have added sugar and it may not be apparent on their ingredient labels. Nutrition labels may mention added sugars in the form of fruit juice concentrate, molasses, honey, syrup, fructose or dextrose.
For this reason, you should avoid packaged or processed foods with unknown ingredients and choose products that are as pure and unprocessed as possible.
People with diabetes should be cautious when consuming dried fruit, fruit juice or processed fruit salad as these often contain added sugar.<br>
Artificial sweeteners are low in calories, but research shows they still have a negative impact on blood sugar by increasing insulin resistance.<br>
<div></div><br>
							  2. Processed or fatty meats<br>
Eating even small amounts of red meat, such as beef, pork or lamb, may increase the risk of diabetes
Additionally, people with diabetes should consider avoiding or limiting consumption of: breaded, fried, and high-sodium meats, processed meats, such as bacon, sausage, and ham, ribs and other fatty meats, poultry with skin, and fried fish<br>
Processed meats tend to be high in sodium or salt. People with high blood pressure should also be especially careful and reduce their sodium intake.<br>
<div></div><br>
3. Fats to avoid<br>
Unhealthy fats can increase cholesterol levels and contribute to insulin resistance. This may increase the risk of developing diabetes or contribute to high blood sugar levels in people with this condition.<br>
Saturated fat<br>
Found mainly in animal products, oils and processed foods. A person should consume less than 10% of daily calories from saturated fat.
Some foods high in saturated fat include: butter, lard, some oils, such as palm oil, cream-based sauces and dips, fatty mayonnaise, foods breaded and breaded, many prepared foods, hamburgers, most fast foods, many salad dressings<br>
Trans fats<br>
Hydrogenation is a process that turns liquid oils into fats. This results in trans fats, which are less healthy than saturated fats.
It is best to avoid all foods containing hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils, as well as foods containing liquid oils.<br>
<div></div><br>
							  
							  4. Sugary drinks<br>
Sugary drinks such as soda, coffee-flavored drinks, many energy drinks, fruit juices, lemonades (and other "-ades"), and some mixed drinks provide empty calories and no calories and do not provide nutrients. Limiting them can help reduce blood sugar, blood fat levels and the risk of developing fatty liver disease.<br>
<div></div><br>
							  
							  5. Foods containing saturated fat<br>
Eating saturated fat can increase cholesterol levels and the risk of heart disease.
Some foods that contain saturated fat are meat and high-fat dairy products, poultry skin, and oils such as palm and coconut.<br>
<div></div><br>
							  
							  6. Alcohol<br>
Current alcohol consumption guidelines recommend a limit of one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men.
If you have diabetes, you may want to limit or avoid alcohol because it can limit your liver's ability to release glucose. Alcohol can also interfere with some diabetes medications.<br>
<div></div><br>
							  7. Ultra-processed foods<br>
This category includes foods high in added sugars, refined grains, unhealthy fats, preservatives and salt.
Ultra-processed foods also contain ingredients you shouldn't add to your food, like high-fructose corn syrup. Eating these foods significantly increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.<br>
<div></div><br>
							  8. Carbohydrates to avoid<br>
There are three main types of carbohydrates in foods: starch, sugar and fiber. Starches and sugars are the biggest problem for people with diabetes because the body breaks them down into glucose.<br>
Refined Carbohydrates<br>
Refined carbohydrates, or refined starches, are broken down during processing before reaching our plates. Through this treatment, the body quickly absorbs carbohydrates and converts them into glucose. This increases blood sugar levels and means a person may feel hungry again soon after a meal.
For people with diabetes or at risk of the disease, some examples of carbohydrate sources to limit include white rice and anything made with only white flour, such as: white bread, white pasta, certain cereals, crackers, and many baked goods<br>
Monitoring total carbohydrate intake per meal can help a person maintain blood sugar levels within the target range.<br>
<div></div><br>
Conclusion<br>
Having diabetes or prediabetes doesn't necessarily mean you should completely avoid certain foods or food groups. But eating less of certain foods can help maintain healthy blood sugar levels and reduce your risk of other chronic diseases.

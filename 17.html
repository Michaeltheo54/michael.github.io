Beautiful games can evoke the most extreme emotions and feelings. Every football fan on this planet has a team they love and conversely has a team they hate, their opponents.
Football has seen many inter-club rivalries develop over its long and rich history, some of which date back more than a century. During this time, countless managers and players have come and gone, but the clubs still exist, their pride and heritage passed from generation to generation to fuel competition.<br>
Football is filled with rivalries, from hype like MLS Gameweek to tournaments surrounding the cultural divides created throughout history. Skeptics might argue that this exists to increase interest in soccer betting odds, but there is a lot of real competition in the sport.
These rivalries make football the greatest sport in the world.<br>
Football offers many exciting matches but nothing can compare to a good derby. The biggest rivalries in football create an incredible, vibrant atmosphere.
A derby is a competition between two football clubs. The term is often used to refer to a famous competitor and most of them have their own nicknames. Every season, many fans eagerly wait for specific derbies that give rise to legendary football matches with super hot atmospheres.<br>
No match is as important as the derby. It's not just about football matches; these are topics where the pride of the club and its fans is at stake. It's an all-out war for bragging rights. <br>

Below are some of the most prestigious and exciting derbies in world football.<br>

1. El Clasico<br>
El Clásico is one of the most exciting derbies in the football world. This is a dispute between two giants of Spanish football, Real Madrid and Barcelona. The match was watched by millions of people around the world as both clubs have huge fan bases across the globe.
El Clásico is probably the most famous match in the world. Everyone knows that El Clásico represents the derby between Barcelona and Real Madrid. The first match between these two clubs took place in 1902, when Real Madrid was still known as Madrid CF. FC Barcelona won this friendly match with a score of 3-1.<br>
But the derby was not yet born… The rivalry arose from a political context that had long been sensitive. Real Madrid is considered to represent Spanish nationalism, while Barcelona is considered to represent Catalan nationalism. These two ideologies clashed and thus the El Clásico derby was born.
The presence of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo takes the iconic battle between the two glamorous football teams to a new level, based on intense analysis and debate down to the smallest detail.<br>
The rivalry between Barcelona and Real Madrid has less to do with football and more to do with politics. It began in the 1900s, and although generations have come and gone, anger on both sides still runs high.
This originated during the Spanish Civil War, when people saw football as a way to express their political affiliation, wearing jerseys on non-playing days as a sign of public rebellion declare.<br>
The Nationalists won the war and caused mass executions. Shortly after, World War 2 began, and leader Fransisco Franco declared neutrality despite having similar political beliefs to Nazi Germany.
With so much history attached to these teams, the divide between players and fans is still mixed with political opinions.<br>
2. Arsenal vs Tottenham<br>
The North London derby is played between the two most notable clubs from London, Arsenal and Tottenham. As one of the fiercest derbies in English football, this event always makes for an exciting match played at a fast pace. This match always attracts a large audience, especially when they play at Wembley.
When they first met in 1909, there was no rivalry between the two clubs. Arsenal comes from the Woolwich district in south-east London. But when Arsenal moved to Highbury, north London, Spurs supporters were not happy. Arsenal entered Tottenham territory and the stadiums were only 5km apart. With the arrival of the Gunners in North London, a rivalry was born: the North London Derby.<br>
Arsenal have the edge in terms of wins and league success.
This rivalry began after World War I, when owner Sir Henry Norris used power and money to bring Arsenal to the First Division of English football, far ahead of Tottenham.<br>
The English Football Association opened the competition with 2 new teams. Moving it to a league with 22 teams instead of 20.
This meant that other teams were able to claim first place in the first and second divisions.<br>
Instead of picking the strongest team to move up the ranks, the league asked for the owners to vote. Tottenham should have taken that role, but Sir Norris, with his wealth and power, secured the lucrative First Division spot.<br>


3. Corinthians vs Palmeiras<br>
The Paulista Derby is the biggest rivalry in Brazil. The football rivals, Corinthians and Palmeiras, are the two oldest clubs in São Paulo.
Sao Paulo is the home ground of Derby Paulista. Like the seasonal flu, what makes the derby so fierce is the large number of football-loving fans in this part of the world.<br>
This passion often turns to violence, both on and off the field, as crowd disturbances and clashes between players often become the main focus of matches.
The increased tension in the match comes from the fact that both teams have participated in many high-stakes matches, whether in cups or leagues.<br>
The rivalry began in 1917 when Corinthians, unbeaten in 25 matches, lost 3–0 to relatively new Palmeiras. The Corinthians could not believe it and this defeat has never been forgotten.
Palmeiras have scored some epic wins against their opponents. Like the remarkable 1933 match where Palmeiras beat Corinthians 8-0. And in 2020, Palmeiras defeated Corinthians in the Campeonato Paulista final. The Paulista Derby is undoubtedly one of the most famous matches in football.<br>



4. Ajax vs Feyenoord<br>
De Klassieker is a derby originating from the Netherlands and everyone knows two football rivals: Amsterdam and Rotterdam.
De Klassieker is the Dutch version of the classic football match. The rivalry arose between the “Artists” of Amsterdam and the “Workers” of Rotterdam and stemmed from their successes and closeness.<br>
De Klassieker tops the list of football's biggest derbies, along with FC Barcelona v Real Madrid (El Clásico) and Glasgow Rangers v Celtic (The Old Firm Derby).
The first match between these two clubs took place in 1917, but the rivalry began in earnest in 1921. Ajax finished top in the First Division, closely followed by Feyenoord. When they faced each other on the field in Rotterdam, the score was 2-3 for the Amsterdammers. Feyenoord objected and the result was 2-2. Their rivalry has been on fire ever since. Massive riots took place before, during and after the matches. Torches, fireworks and sometimes bombs are lit around the event. <br>
Both clubs have enjoyed great success throughout their history, including four European Cup titles in the 1970s.
However, throughout the history of this match, there has always been violence between supporters, peaking in 1997 in what became known as the Battle of Beverwijk.<br>
The fight was essentially a massive motorway brawl between supporters of rival clubs and resulted in the death of one supporter. As a result, the Dutch government has initiated reforms to combat the escalation of violence in football.<br>


5. Benfica vs FC Porto<br>
S.L. Benfica and FC Porto are two of the most prestigious clubs in the Primeira Liga. They also represent Lisbon and Porto, the two largest cities in Portugal, respectively. Benfica is known as a laid-back club, while Porto is known as a hard-working and fighting team. This clash of cultures has led to competition with a lot of friction.
Two teams, two cities, one country and one ultimate goal: to become the best football club in their country. Benfica is always the top team in the national championship. In contrast, Porto has achieved more success in the European arena. <br>

6. Olympique de Marseille vs. Paris Saint-Germain<br>
Le Classique, one of the biggest football rivalries in France is the match between Marseille and Paris Saint-Germain. The participation of these football rivals in legendary football matches is known to arouse strong emotions. Their matches in the 1970s showed little sign that the two would become a great rivalry. At the time, the newly formed Parisians were looking to build a competitive team, while the Olympians were contenders for the Ligue 1 title.
Everything changed in 1986 when PSG won first championship and Olympique de Marseille was bought by Bernard Tapie. At the end of the decade, PSG were competing for the 1988–89 championship with Tapie's Marseille, and the rivalry began<br>
If the fierce rivalry is due to political and social aspects rather than closeness, it also comes from the success of the two clubs as the two strongest teams in France.
With PSG recently inheriting huge wealth and being hated by the whole of France, you can understand why Marseille fans would balk at their enemies' money and add fuel to the fire.<br>
The matches between both clubs have been plagued with problems due to fan problems and rarely did a match take place without violence and numerous arrests.<br>


7. Manchester United vs Manchester City<br>
The Manchester derby is the most exciting match of the Premier League derbies. The Manchester Derby takes place between two ancient city rivals Manchester United and Manchester City. These meetings always attract a large number of attendees. This derby gives Manchester City the chance to eclipse their most popular opponents. It also gives Manchester United the opportunity to showcase some of the best English players to compete in the sport.
Like many derbies, this derby also has a dramatic scene. The notable match in 2011 was Manchester United's heavy loss when Man City won 6-1. In recent times, Manchester City have been playing an attractive brand of football while also winning more recent Premier League titles.<br>


8. Liverpool vs Everton<br>
The Merseyside derby has been dubbed the 'friendly derby '. The derby is entirely based on location, as Everton and Liverpool play 400 meters apart. There appears to be no real social or political division between these clubs. However, their competition is fierce. This feud is still fierce as this derby holds the record for the most red cards in the Premier League.
Although Liverpool has long surpassed Everton in the rankings, both teams are taking this derby seriously because they want to win the title of Liverpool's best club.<br>


9. Olympiacos F.C. vs Panathinaikos F.C.<br>
Athens itself has a wonderful history and many stories of ancient battles; football teams are no different.
The intensity of the rivalry between Olympiacos and Panathinaikos stems from upper-class Panathinaikos fans and working-class Olympiakos fans, who often take responsibility for social and political injustice.<br>
Panathinaikos is based in the capital Athens, representing the upper class and ancient Athenians. Olympiacos plays in Piraeus, a port city with a working-class fan base.
At many of the biggest derbies, fan violence and hooliganism are never far away.<br>
This derby also benefits the supporters. Violent incidents often occur when this derby takes place. An incident in 2007 saw a Panathinaikos fan stabbed to death during a clash between fans.
Greece's supporters know how to stir up competition. Violent incidents often occur when this derby takes place. Emotions – as is often the case in derbies – often get the better of the players and fans.<br>

10. West Ham United vs Millwall<br>
The rivalry between West Ham United and Millwall is better known as the Dockers derby. This English derby is old gold and one of England's biggest football matches.
With both teams notorious for hooliganism, it is no wonder that most matches were violent and Hollywood chose this match as the face of hooliganism in football .<br>
The two teams, then known as Millwall Athletic and Thames Ironworks, were both from London's East End. The football rivals are less than 5 km apart. They first met in the FA Cup 1899-1900. In 1910, Millwall moved south of the River Thames and the teams were no longer neighbors in East London. Despite this, derbies are still hotly contested and both supporters still regard the other club as their main rival.<br>
The fact that there are so few meetings between the teams seems to only add fuel to the fire rather than extinguish it.<br>


11. Atletico Madrid vs Real Madrid<br>
During La Liga, people are looking forward to El Derbi Madrileño. One of Madrid's most famous rivalries is between city rivals Real Madrid and Atlético. Real Madrid may win more often in the league, but Atlético is more successful in the Europa League.
This rivalry, like other Spanish rivalries, can be seen as representing a clash of political ideals. Francisco Franco's regime joined Real Madrid, helping the club rise. It was purely political but left its mark, making Real Madrid an ally of the dictator in the minds of many people. Real Madrid was then considered an elite club and Atlético was for working people. Even to this day, the derby between Real and Atlético is still a testament to legendary football matches and a vibrant atmosphere in the stands.<br>
In 2019, these clubs faced each other for the first time in the United States. This match is the most notable match in derby history. The final score was 7-3 in favor of Atlético Madrid.<br>


12. Lazio Roma vs AS Roma<br>
Derby della Capitale is a local football match between two football rivals: Lazio Roma and AS Roma. It is considered the fiercest derby in the country and from the outset has been characterized by large crowds, enthusiasm and passionate supporters.
The derby was born in the 1920s. AS Roma was founded when three Roman clubs merged to challenge the dominance of northern Italian clubs. S.S. Lazio refused to participate in the merger. Since then, these two clubs have been competing for the title of best club in Rome – as is often the case in city derbies. The competitive intensity is intense, often pushing passionate fans to the breaking point.<br>

13. Celtic F.C. vs Rangers F.C.<br>
Celtic F.C. vs Rangers F.C. is one of the biggest rivalries in football. The Old Firm Derby is a match between two of the most successful clubs in Scottish football history, Celtic F.C. and Rangers F.C. This derby is one of the oldest and busiest derbies in the world. Their first match took place in 1888, when the two clubs could still play each other as friends.
The two Glasgow teams are the wealthiest and most successful teams in Scotland. The rivalry is about bragging rights in Glasgow.<br>
The original Old Firm Derby was based on religious differences. The Ranger community is predominantly Protestant and considers itself of Scottish descent.
Over the years, friendly relations gradually faded and hatred grew due to religious differences. The city is geographically divided into a Catholic part and a Protestant part. Celtic have a Catholic faith and Rangers have a Protestant faith. The match also has a history of violence, with some fans involved in pitch invasions and vandalism. So involved are the legions of both clubs that Old Firm Derby is responsible for bringing millions in revenue to the Scottish economy.<br>
Before 1986, the team had not signed a Catholic player in decades. However,
Celtic has a community of Catholic players. Their colors match their Irish heritage.<br>
Cultural and religious divisions fueled this rivalry until 2012. That year, the Rangers experienced a financial collapse.<br>

14. Boca Juniors vs River Plate<br>
Not to be confused with El Súter Clásico, El Superclásico is the rivalry between River Plate and Boca Juniors. They are the most successful clubs in Argentina and have developed a rivalry thanks to finances and the contrast between their two districts in the Argentine capital Buenos Aires.
Superclásico is known around the world as one of the most fierce and famous matches in the world of football. Clásico is a Spanish word meaning derby. And this Argentine derby is called the Superclásico because it sees the most successful and famous clubs compete. Some newspapers and magazines believe that this derby is a must. This is considered one of the biggest rivalries in football.<br>
Since 1913, Boca Juniors and River Plate have competed for the title of best club in Bueno Aires. Boca Juniors is a people's club, while River Plate's fans are largely upper class. The competition is caused by this class difference.

These clubs regularly meet each other in the Copa Libertadores. During the 2010s, River Plate eliminated Boca Juniors five times. The 2015 incident saw a Boca fan attack several River Plate players with pepper spray. This shows that the competition between these clubs is a serious business.<br>
15. AC Milan vs Inter Milan<br>
The Milan derby is considered one of the biggest matches in Italy. It is a competition between city rivals AC Milan and Inter Milan. Both clubs call the San Siro stadium home and both clubs like to say they are the best team on the ground. The origins of this derby lie in the social divide between supporters. Inter Milan is famous for attracting the bourgeoisie while AC Milan attracts the working class. This famous football match in Milan is called the Derby Della Madonnina to honor the statue of the Virgin Mary located in Milan.<br>
Derby della Madonnina is one of the most watched derbies. The name “Derby della Madonnina” was chosen to refer to the statue of the Virgin Mary on top of the Duomo. This statue of the Virgin Mary is also known as “Madonnina”. The first meeting of these football rivals took place in 1909 and both clubs had one goal: to become the best club in Milan. The derby was born out of social divisions between supporters. Inter Milan attracts the lower class, while AC Milan attracts the working class.
Originally the same club, but after a small argument they spat out the effigy, broke up and the feud began.<br>

16. Fenerbahçe vs Galatasaray<br>
Kitalararasi Derbi also known as Intercontinental Derby is a battle between Fenerbahçe SK and Galatasaray SK. This is considered Turkey's greatest football match.
Galatasaray and Fenerbahce are Turkey's most successful teams and when they met in the Kitalar Arasi Derbi ("intercontinental derby"), it captured the imagination of fans on both continents.<br>

Each side of Istanbul represents a different part of the city. Fenerbahçe originates from the Asian part of the municipality, while Galatasaray originates from the European part.

Both clubs were founded in the first decade of the last century. First Gala, by the legendary Ali Sami Yen, then, two years later, Fener, on the opposite bank of the Bosphorus.
The first meeting of these football rivals took place in 1909, so the rivalry between the clubs has existed for about a century. This rivalry has become one of the biggest, fiercest and often fiercest derbies.<br>
This intense football rivalry is dubbed "intercontinental" because Fenerbahçe and Galatasaray are two of the most important Turkish teams on the Asian and European sides of Istanbul. Competition does not arise only for geographical reasons: cultures also clash. Galatasaray is considered a small student-founded club while Fenerbahçe is a truly grassroots club. Fans of both clubs can't stand each other - which is the perfect element for the best derbies in football.<br>


Less than 30 years after their founding, a meeting between two men took a violent turn as a battle between players and supporters changed the course of a previously friendly affair.<br>

17. Liverpool vs Manchester United<br>
The Northwest Derby is considered one of the biggest rivalries in English football, the Northwest derby is one of the most passionate sporting events in the world. Played between arch-rivals Manchester United and Liverpool, this match saw England's two most successful clubs go head-to-head.
The rivalry stems from the proximity of two cities just an hour apart, which has historically created economic and industrial rivalry.<br>
The two towns are only 50 km apart (a very short distance by British standards) and have always been economically and industrially competitive. The derby is even more popular with supporters than matches between local football rivals, such as Everton and Manchester City. This shows how serious and intense the Northwest Derby is. The Northwest Derby is something fans always look forward to and is a testament to the fierceness of English football.
For a long time, the two clubs have been competing with each other to be the best and most successful in England, leading to some heated encounters.<br>
This derby is just one part of the general feud between Manchester and Liverpool. Because the two cities are only 35 miles apart, they compete economically and industrially.<br>


18. Bayern Munich vs Borussia Dortmund<br>
Der Klassiker is one of the biggest rivalries in German football. It was played between two of the most successful clubs in Germany, Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund.
The first match between these two clubs took place in 1965 and the rivalry has continued to grow since then. Dortmund has made a name for itself by winning the Bundesliga championship many times in a row. They won consecutive Bundesliga championships; the 1995–96 season brought Bayern Munich to second place.<br>
During the 2010s, this rivalry reached new heights and both clubs were constant contenders for the Bundesliga title. From the rowdy crowds to the best of football on display, you shouldn't miss the chance to witness this epic battle.<br>

Barack Obama was the 44th president of the United States and the very first African American to hold the office. Before he ventured into politics, he served as a civil-rights lawyer, community organizer, and teacher. 
He was elected to the Presidency of America in 2008, and won the re-election in 2012
 But how was he able to attain such heights of success and where did it all start?<br>
Barack Obama was born on the 4th of August 1961 in Honolulu, Hawaii, United States. His father, Barack Obama Sr., grew up in rural Kenya. When he was a teenager he got interested in obtaining major at university, and after making several attempts, he received an invitation from the University of Hawaii, was awarded a scholarship, and later on became a senior economist in the Kenyan government. In 1959, he left Nairobi and relocated to Hawaii. <br>


His mother, S. Ann Dunham, was an American anthropologist that specialized in economic anthropology and rural development. She grew up in Kansas, Texas, and Washington state before her family finally settled in Honolulu. She then enrolled at The University of Hawaii.
She and Barack Obama Sr met in a Russian language class at the University of Hawaii in 1960 and married less than a year later. Soon after the marriage, they gave birth to a son and named him Barack Hussein Obama II.<br>


Dunham’s parents, Obama’s maternal grandparents, raised Obama while his parents were studying. 
When Obama was age two, his father enrolled to study at Harvard University and shortly after that, in March 1964, his parents got divorced.<br>
After just a year, his mother, Ann Dunham married Lolo Soetoro who was an Indonesian student at the University of Hawaii.
Obama was six years when the family moved to Jakarta, Indonesia.  In Jakarta, his mother taught English to businesspeople, while Lolo worked as a geologist. On the 15th of August, 1970, Ann gave birth to Maya, Obama’s half-sister.
When Obama was 10, he moved back to Hawaii.<br> He lived with his maternal grandparents until graduating from high school. Barack Obama attended Punahou School in Honolulu and began his academic course from the fifth grade. In 1979, he graduated.
After graduating from high school, Barack Obama decided to go to Los Angeles and enroll at Occidental College. At the college, he took advantage of a transfer program and moved to Columbia University in New York City. While at New York, he took his studies seriously and worked hard.<br>

In 1983, he graduated from Columbia University with a major in Political Science. After graduation, Obama worked as a project coordinator in a global business-consulting firm Business International Group in New York and later moved to Chicago to work as the executive director of Developing Communities Project. He then decided to obtain a degree in law and in 1988, he became a student of Harvard Law School.<br> After enrolling, he served as a summer associate at Sidley Austin law firm in Chicago where he met his future wife, Michelle Robinson, who was assigned to mentor him during his internship and also worked as a practicing attorney. Later, he was selected as the editor of the Harvard Law Review at the end of his first year, but that was not all, he later won the presidential election of the Harvard Law Review for the academic year of 1990-1991 making him the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review and became popular with the media. <br>

In 1991 Barack Obama graduated from Harvard Law School. He traveled to Kenya again in 1992 with his fiancée Michelle and his half-sister Auma. Finally, on October 3, 1992, Barack and Michelle married got married after four years of courtship.<br>


He then returned to Chicago, where he practiced civil rights law and became active in the Democratic Party. He also taught constitutional law at The University of Chicago Law School.<br>

He was elected to the Illinois Senate in 1996. He continued to aim at higher political positions and in 2004 he was elected to the U.S. Senate after defeating Republican Alan Keyes in the first U.S. Senate race in which the two leading candidates were both African Americans.  In the summer of 2004, he gained a lot of national recognition after he delivered the keynote speech in support of John Kerry at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston. It was the speech of unity: “There is not a liberal America and a conservative America – there is the United States of America. There is not a Black America and a White America and Latino America and Asian America – there’s the United States of America.” The address changed Obama’s political career and the following year, he quickly became a major figure in his party.<br>
On February 10, 2007, Obama announced his presidential candidacy for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. His rival was the former First Lady, Hillary Clinton. She was leading in the polls, even among African-American voters. However, during the primaries, Obama won more states and actual delegates, many left Clinton and went to Obama.<br> On June 3, following the final primaries, the number of delegates pledged to Obama surpassed the total necessary to claim the Democratic nomination and on August 27 Obama became the first African American to be nominated for the presidency by either major party and went on to challenge Republican Sen. John McCain for the office of the presidency. McCain criticized Obama, claiming he was too inexperienced for the job. In an attempt to counter that, Obama selected Joe Biden, who was a veteran senator with a long resume of foreign policy expertise, to be his vice presidential running mate. <br>

On election night tens of thousands gathered in Chicago’s Grant Park to see Barack Obama claim victory and finally on the 20th of January 2009, hundreds of thousands turned out in Washington, D.C., to witness him taking the oath of office as president.<br>
On November 4, 2008, Obama won the election after receiving 52.9 percent against the 45.7 percent of Republican presidential nominee John McCain. He became the 44th President of the United States and the very first African-American to hold this office. 
He contested for the second time in 2012 and won the re-election. <br>
Barack Obama make notable achievements during his first and second terms as president.
Because of his efforts to get the US economy back on track, the private sector created thousands of jobs.<br>
The Congress provided expanded health care insurance for children and provided legal protection for women seeking equal pay. 
He cut taxes for all American workers, first-time home buyers and small businesses. 
He made quality and affordable health care for the millions of U.S. citizens.<br>
In addition, he also developed U.S. foreign policy and was the first to open dialogue with Iran, Cuba, and Venezuela and improve relations with Russia, Europe and China.<br>
In 2009, he won the Nobel Peace Prize, he is also the winner of the 2006 and 2008 Grammy Awards, as well as Time’s Person of the Year in 2008 and 2012.<br>

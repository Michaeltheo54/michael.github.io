Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the buzzwords in tech right now, and with good reason. It is a method that allows computers, computer-controlled robots or software to think intelligently like the human mind. AI is done by studying the patterns of the human brain and analyzing cognitive processes. The results of these studies develop intelligent software and systems.<br>
Experts see artificial intelligence as a factor of production, with the potential to create new sources of growth and change the way work is done across industries.<br>

The AI ​​journey began in the 1950s with the pioneering work of Alan Turing, who proposed the Turing test to determine whether a machine could imitate human intelligence. In the 1960s, AI research gained momentum with the development of the first AI programming language, LISP, by John McCarthy. Early AI systems focused on symbolic reasoning and rule-based systems, leading to the development of expert systems in the 1970s and 1980s.<br>

The 1990s saw a shift focusing on machine learning and data-driven approaches, driven by the increasing availability of digital data and advances in computing power. This period saw the rise of neural networks and the development of support vector machines, which enabled AI systems to learn from data, delivering better performance and adaptability.<br> In the 2000s, AI research expanded into new areas, including natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics, paving the way for today's AI revolution.<br>

Artificial intelligence has become a formidable tool in recent years, allowing robots to think and act like humans. Furthermore, it has attracted the attention of IT companies worldwide and is considered the next major technological revolution after the development of mobile and cloud platforms.<br>
<div></div><br>
Past<br>
For nearly six decades, AI is developing at a steady pace. Its development is reflected in the improvement of AI technologies such as machine learning and AI programming, but above all in the growing intelligence of AI applications.
Although artificial intelligence has existed for millennia, it was not until the 1950s that its true potential was discovered. A generation of scientists, physicists and intellectuals came up with the idea of ​​AI, but it wasn't until Alan Turing, the British mathematician, proposed that humans could solve problems and make decisions using available information and also reason.<br> Computer difficulties were the main obstacle to expansion. They had to adapt fundamentally before they could grow further. The machine could execute commands but does not store them.<br>
In 1958, the Lisp programming language was invented at MIT by John McCarthy. Lisp is considered one of the most suitable languages ​​for developing AI applications. Then, many years later, in 1968, a programmer named Richard Greenblatt built an intelligent, knowledge-based chess program that achieved a Class C tournament rating. This was the precursor to several other AI applications, including programs that beat world chess champions.<br> Another major AI milestone came in 1979, when INTERNIST was developed, a knowledge-based medical diagnostic program capable of leveraging clinical knowledge to make a diagnosis. It was one of the first expert systems in the medical field. In addition to medical and gaming applications, Allstar Advice Inc. developed the first commercial strategy and management consulting system in 1987. The system was called Alacrity and was capable of analyzing and interpreting financial models and financial statements based on more 3,000 rules.

Another revolutionary moment occurred in 1997, when the world witnessed IBM's Deep Blue chess machine defeat then-world chess champion Garry Kasparov. In the same year, the first official RoboCup soccer tournament was held with the participation of nearly 40 interactive robot teams. This important milestone marked the development of complex robots and their use in a variety of applications. By 2005, Honda's ASIMO robot, an artificially intelligent humanoid robot, was the first machine capable of walking as fast as a human.<br> ASIMO is used to deliver trays to customers at restaurants. Two years later, checkers were solved by a computer program that played checkers that could not be lost. Never. This was created by a team of researchers from the University of Alberta, Canada. At the same time, Google also launched an effort to build self-driving cars, which was officially announced in 2009.<br>

Today, most automakers are on a roadmap to deploy autonomous vehicles as soon as 2020. As part of their autonomous vehicle strategies, automakers are also establishing partnerships exclusively with advanced AI research institutes to equip their cars with the ability to reason about the driving context and make optimal driving decisions.<br>
Personal Assistant Robot, offers one of the most tangible applications of AI in the consumer space. Support robots perform tasks such as providing information to users, sending warning signals in case of emergency as well as entertaining users. An example is the ASUS Zenbo robot.<br>
The above list is not exhaustive but it is representative of real-world uses of AI today. The increasing penetration of robots into real-world applications can be explained by radical advances in AI technology. Indeed, over the past few years, we have seen new advances in the evolution of AI technology.<br>
Artificial intelligence is used for so many things and holds so much promise that it's hard to imagine our future without it, in terms of business. AI technology is driving productivity like never before, from workflow management solutions to trend forecasting and even the way businesses buy advertising. Artificial intelligence can collect and organize huge volumes of data to make conclusions and estimates that are beyond the ability of humans to understand manually. It also improves organizational efficiency while reducing the risk of errors and immediately identifying unusual patterns, such as spam and fraud, to immediately alert organizations to any suspicious behavior, along with many other acts.<br> AI is becoming so important and sophisticated that a Japanese investment firm became the first to nominate an AI board member for its ability to predict market trends faster than humans. Artificial intelligence will indeed be used in many aspects of life, such as self-driving cars in the coming years, more accurate weather forecasts and earlier health diagnoses, etc.<br>

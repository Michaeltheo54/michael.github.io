Humans have many abilities, one of which is creativity. It is this ability that has led to many scientific and technological breakthroughs and inventions that have helped shape the world around us. In this article, we will explore the 10 most important inventions of all time and how they came to be.<br>
<div></div><br>
1. Internet<br>
The Internet as we know it today is an even more modern invention.
It is a global system of interconnected computer networks used by billions of people around the world.<br>
In the 1960s, a group of computer scientists working for the U.S. Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) built a communications network to connect the agency's computers, called ARPANET, the predecessor of the Internet. It used a data transmission method called "packet switching", developed by computer scientist and team member Lawrence Roberts, based on previous work by other computer scientists. <br>
This technology was developed in the 1970s by scientists Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf, who developed the essential communications protocols for the Internet, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet (IP),<br>
In 1989, the Internet took off again. thanks to the invention of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee while working at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research). The creation of the World Wide Web was responsible for transforming our communications, commerce, entertainment, and politics. According to CERN, "the basic idea of ​​the WWW is to unite the evolving technologies of computers, data networks and hypertext into one powerful, easy-to-use global information system". The development of the WWW opened up the world of the Internet to everyone and connected the world in ways never seen before. Now, anyone with a basic computer and Internet access has access to a basically unlimited treasure trove of information. What's even more incredible is that it offers anyone (anywhere) a media platform with greater capacity and wider reach than the mighty commercial broadcasting companies.<br>

2. Penicillin<br>
Penicillin was discovered by Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming, it was one of the first drugs used to fight disease and it improved and saved countless lives. Additionally, this drug transformed medicine with its ability to cure bacterial infections. This was the beginning of the antibiotic era.
In 1928, Alexander Fleming noticed that a petri dish in his laboratory was filled with bacteria but its lid was accidentally left ajar. The sample was contaminated with mold, and wherever mold was present, the bacteria were dead. This antibiotic fungus turned out to be Penicillium, and over the next two decades, chemists purified it and developed the drug penicillin, which is effective against a large number of bacterial infections in the United States.<br>
Although penicillin was discovered by Alexander Fleming, it proved difficult to produce in large quantities until the mid-1940s. In fact, the first patient was treated with Merck penicillin produced in the United States in 1942, and this single patient used up half of the total supply produced. Finally, production was resolved and the United States was producing 646 billion units per year by 1945.<br>

3. Printing Press<br>
The printing press was invented in 1439 by German Johannes Gutenberg. Before Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press and portable typewriter in the early 1400s, books and other documents were created by hand. Although others before him - including inventors in China and Korea - had developed movable metal type, Gutenberg was the first to create a mechanized process for transferring ink (which he made from linseed oil and soot) onto paper. Using this portable typing process, the printing press increased the speed at which copies of books were made exponentially, leading to the rapid and widespread spread of knowledge for the first time in history.<br>
This device, in many ways, laid the foundation for our modern age. It allows mechanized transfer of ink from movable type to paper. This revolutionized the transmission of knowledge and religion, because books were previously written by hand (usually by monks).<br>
After printing mechanized book production, the number of books increased exponentially, reaching 20 million by 1500 and more than 200 million ten years later. This book boom promoted literacy and spread knowledge around the world.<br>
<div></div><br>
4. Wheels<br>
Before the invention of the wheel in 3500 BC, people were severely limited in the amount of stuff they could transport over land and the distance. <br>
Wheels are everywhere, but what's interesting is that historians say the first wheels were not used for transportation. Evidence suggests that the first wheels were potters' wheels invented by the Mesopotamians around 3,500 BC, for use in creating pottery. About 300 years later, the wheels were put on horse-drawn carriages and the rest is history. Wheels are omnipresent in our daily lives, facilitating our transportation and trade.<br>
Wheeled carts facilitated agriculture and trade by allowing goods to be transported to and from markets and easing the burden on those who had to travel long distances. Today, wheels are essential to our lives, found in everything from watches to vehicles to turbines.<br>
<div></div><br>
5. Airplane<br>
The human ability to fly has captured the imagination of inventors for centuries, with the first human-piloted flight taking place in 1783 when Joseph-Michael and Jacques -Ètienne Montgolfier flew in a hot air balloon. In 1853, British engineer George Cayley designed the first glider to achieve successful flight, but it was not until 1903 that Orville and Wilbur Wright invented the airplane and their plane became the first achieved successful flight. Not only did it take off from Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, under its own power; it flew and landed without being destroyed, unlike many previous aviation inventions. The Wright Brothers were inspired by watching birds in flight. The glider is inspired by bird wings but has a wingspan of 10 meters.<br>
Airplanes have brought the world closer together, allowing us to travel great distances quickly. This technology has expanded minds through vast cultural exchange<br>
It's hard to believe that just over 50 years later, Boeing introduced the 707. And just 66 years after the Wright brothers' first flight, in 1969, Apollo 11 landed on the Moon.<br>
<div></div><br>
6. Cars<br>
Cars radically changed the way we travel and the design of cities and brought the concept of the assembly line into mainstream. They were invented in their modern form in the late 19th century by a number of individuals, especially thanks to the German Karl Benz for creating what is considered the first practical automobile in 1885.<br>
Cars are one of the first complex high-volume machines produced.  The automobiles quickly became ubiquitous and necessary. It led to the construction of highways and byways, impacted where people worked and lived, and had a profound impact on America's social fabric.<br>
<div></div><br>
7. Telephone<br>
Like many other inventions, the telephone was developed by many different people and each person made their contribution.<br>
Scottish-born inventor Alexander Graham Bell began researching this type of technology, although he was not the only one: he received the first patent for an electric telephone in 1876.
Some inventors did pioneering work on electronic voice transmission, much of which he later sued for intellectual property rights as telephone use exploded - but it was Alexander Graham Bell who was the first to receive a patent for the electric telephone on March 7, 1876.<br>

Bell's inspiration for the telephone was influenced by his family. His father taught speech and specialized in teaching speech to the deaf, his mother, a talented musician, later lost her hearing, and his wife Mabel, whom he married in 1877, became deaf at the age of five. This invention quickly took off and revolutionized commerce and communication on a global scale. When Bell died on August 2, 1922, all telephone service in the United States and Canada was shut down for one minute in his memory.<br>
Telephones made voice communication possible, reducing the distance between people.<br>
Undoubtedly, this tool has revolutionized our ability to communicate.<br>
<div></div><br>
8. Light bulb<br>
The invention of the light bulb changed our world by eliminating our dependence on natural light, allowing us to work productively at any time of the day or night. Several inventors played key roles in developing this revolutionary technology throughout the 1800s; Thomas Edison is considered the first inventor because he created a fully functional lighting system, including a generator and wiring as well as a carbon filament light bulb in 1879.<br>
In addition to starting to bring electricity into every home in the Western world, this invention also had a rather unexpected consequence: changing people's sleeping habits. Instead of going to bed at nightfall (with nothing else to do) and sleeping in chunks throughout the night separated by periods of waking, we are now awake except for the 7-8 hours allotted to us.<br>
<div></div><br>
9. Vaccines<br>
The first rudimentary vaccinations are believed to date back to 10th century China, when small doses of smallpox were injected into the skin to protect against the disease. But in 1796, English physician Edward Jenner discovered that milkmaids rarely got sick or died from smallpox because they were previously infected with the cowpox virus, also known as Vaccinia. So he used smallpox to develop a smallpox vaccine. He inoculated an eight-year-old boy against smallpox, and the boy never contracted this deadly scourge. Jenner's experiments led to the creation of the smallpox vaccine and his work is considered the beginning of immunology. In 1980, smallpox was officially declared eliminated by WHO. But scientists continue to develop new life-saving vaccines, including one against the coronavirus that will play a vital role in the fight against the pandemic. A rabies vaccine was developed by the French chemist and biologist Louis Pasteur in 1885, who is credited with turning vaccines into the primary medicine they are today. Pasteur was also responsible for inventing the food-safe pasteurization process that bears his name.
Vaccination is essentially a way of making the body fight off and remember a disease – so that when it occurs in the future, the body is ready to recognize and destroy that disease before it happens and cannot be replicated up in large quantities. Although sometimes controversial, vaccination is effective in eradicating diseases and prolonging human life.<br>
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 2 to 3 million lives are saved each year through vaccination against infectious diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and measles.<br>

10. Nails<br>
The first use of this very simple but extremely useful metal fastener dates back to ancient Egypt, around 3400 BC. This important invention only became a reality after humans developed the ability to cast and shape metal. Previously, wooden structures had to be built by joining adjacent planks together geometrically, a much more arduous construction process.<br>

Until the 1790s and early 1800s, hand forging of nails was the norm, with blacksmiths heating a square bar of iron then hammering the four edges to form a spike. Nail machines appeared from the 1790s to the early 1800s. Nail technology continued to develop; after Henry Bessemer developed a process for mass-producing steel from iron, old iron nails gradually declined and by 1886, 10% of nails in America were made from sweet steel wire. In 1913, 90% of nails produced in America were steel wire.<br>

There are several factors that contribute to his fame, firstly his great accomplishments as a world champion bodybuilder who then became a Hollywood action movie star, and then a successful businessman, who then became a best-selling author, and ultimately a Governor of the state of California.<br>
In this article, we are going to focus on his journey to success and rise to fame.<br>
He was born on July 30, 1947, in Thal, a small village near Graz, Austria. He was the second son. <br>
Being born and raised in a country that had just suffered a brutal defeat in a world war, had a huge impact on Arnold. However, these experiences would motivate Arnold to want to escape from Austria to America and also ultimately shape his drive and determination to succeed.<br>
Arnold’s father, followed a strict and approach to parenting. He expected Arnold and his older brother to excel in sports and follow a disciplined lifestyle.<br>
His interest in bodybuilding began at the age of 15 when he came across a magazine featuring a bodybuilder known as Reg Park. Reg Park was a body builder champion who leveraged his success in body building to make it into Hollywood. He became inspired by Park’s journey from a muscleman to a successful movie star and decided to follow the same path.<br>

He trained for five hours a day six days a week in a local gym. His determination and commitment led him to becoming the youngest European Champion bodybuilder of his time, and that was at the age of 20.
Over the next 15 years, he continued to dominate the world of bodybuilding by receiving numerous awards and accolades.<br> 
Arnold’s success in the world of competitive bodybuilding was unparalleled. He claimed the Mr. Universe title an astonishing four times before moving to California in 1968 to compete in bigger events. While in the United States, he also continued to dominate the field, winning three more Mr. Universe titles.<br>
But it didn’t stop there. From 1970 to 1975, he won the Mr. Olympia title six consecutive times, and that was not all, he also won the award a seventh time in 1980, after a brief retirement.<br>

His remarkable achievements in bodybuilding opened the door for him to enter Hollywood, where he ultimately became one of the most successful action stars in movie history.

Having considered America to be a land of opportunity, he got the ticket to move to the USA with his Mr. Universe trophy.
During his start on the journey of acting, he was casted in the movie – Hercules in New York in 1969. After that, his debut movie named-  Pumping Iron made him well known and brought him increasing fame. <br>
He made a name for himself in Hollywood  after he was awarded with a Golden Globe award for new male star of the year. 
A few years later, he would blow up in the industry after being cast as Conan the Barbarian. <br>
His role in Conan the Barbarian in 1982 was praised even by the film critics. Next, he starred as the lead role in the sequel Conan the Destroyer and in the same year, he got casted as a lead role in the famous movie - The Terminator. This movie brought him to limelight and solidified his image as an action hero.
From this point forward, he would go on to achieve more success in the movie industry, as he would go on to make hit after hit with movies like

Conan the Destroyer, The Terminator, Commando, Predator, Red Heat, Kindergarten Cop, Terminator 2, True Lies, The Expendables, and many more.
But his story did not end with Hollywood, so after many years of success in the movie industry, he would set his eyes on politics.  So in 200 he decided to run for Governor of California and succeeded in winning the office and that made him become the 38th Governor of the state of California. <br>
Under his governance, California saw budgetary reforms, including a balanced budget amendment to the state constitution in 2008, and deep budget cuts in 2009. <br>
His political career spanned from 2003 to 2011. It was marked by resilience and determination. He successfully balanced his reputation both as a Hollywood icon and bodybuilding legend with his role as a serious, hardworking and dedicated politician.
I'm addition to his achievements, he built a vast business empire that contributed to his net worth which is estimated to be around $300 to $450 million. Note that he did not make his first million in the entertainment industry, he became a millionaire through real estate and entrepreneurial ventures, and that was just at the young age of 25.<br>
Arnold’s journey from poverty to wealth and stardom is quite remarkable. His career began in bodybuilding, where he went on to become a dominant force in the sport, winning numerous awards, which opened the doors to Hollywood, rising to fame in blockbuster action movies, building a multimillion dollar business empire, and then venturing into politics, ultimately serving as the Governor of California.

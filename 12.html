								<h3>The amazing health benefits of garlic </h3>
							</header>
						  <img src="14.jpg" width="50%" height="">
							<div id="two">Garlic is a popular culinary ingredient that has several health benefits. Throughout history, people have used garlic to prevent and treat various conditions and diseases.
Garlic belongs to the genus Allium and is closely related to onions, rakkyo (a type of onion found in Asia), scallions, chives, leeks and shallots. It has been used by humans for thousands of years and was used in ancient Egypt for both culinary purposes as well as health and therapeutic benefits.<br>
This plant has medicinal properties due to its antibacterial and antiseptic properties. The beneficial properties of garlic are due to the compound allicin. It is rich in minerals such as phosphorus, zinc, potassium and magnesium. Vitamins C, K, folate, niacin and thiamine are also found in abundance in garlic.<br>
<div></div><br>
1. Garlic can help fight illness, including colds.<br>
Raw garlic has the ability to prevent cough and cold infections. Eating two crushed garlic cloves on an empty stomach will provide maximum benefits. For children and infants, hanging garlic cloves around the neck is said to relieve symptoms of nasal congestion.
Garlic oil may have anti-inflammatory properties. If you have pain and inflammation in your joints or muscles, applying garlic oil topically may be beneficial. Rubbing the affected area with garlic oil can help reduce inflammation and relieve pain.<br>
Garlic and garlic supplements may help prevent and reduce the severity of illnesses such as flu and colds.
Research conducted in 2016 shows that aged garlic extract (AGE), as a supplement, can strengthen your immune system.<br>
Other research suggests that compounds found in garlic may have antiviral properties. In addition to strengthening your immune system, it can help prevent viruses from entering host cells or multiplying in your cells.<br>
<div></div><br>
2. Garlic contains compounds with powerful medicinal properties.<br>
Garlic grows in many parts of the world and is a popular ingredient in cooking thanks to its strong smell and delicious flavor.
However, throughout ancient history, people have widely used garlic for its medicinal and health properties. There is documentary evidence of its use by many major civilizations, including the Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Chinese and Indians.<br>
Scientists now know that most of the health benefits of garlic are due to the formation of sulfur compounds when you cut, crush, or chew a clove of garlic.<br>
Perhaps the best known compound is allicin. However, allicin is an unstable compound that appears only briefly in fresh garlic after cutting or crushing.<br>
Other compounds that may play a role in the health benefits of garlic include diallyl disulfide and s-allyl cysteine.
The sulfur compounds in garlic enter your body through the digestive tract. They then move throughout your body, causing powerful biological effects.<br>
<div></div><br>
3. Active compounds in garlic may reduce blood pressure.<br>
Allicin, a compound found in garlic, prevents the oxidation of LDL (bad cholesterol). This reduces cholesterol levels and improves heart health. Regular consumption of garlic reduces the rate of blood clotting and thus helps prevent thrombosis. Garlic also reduces blood pressure and is therefore good for patients with hypertension.
Researchers from Ankara University studied the effects of garlic extract supplementation on the blood lipid (fat) profile of patients with high blood cholesterol levels. <br>
They supplemented with garlic extract for 4 months and had their blood lipid parameters, as well as kidney and liver function, regularly monitored.
At the end of 4 months, researchers concluded garlic extract supplementation improves blood lipid profile, enhances the blood's antioxidant capacity, and leads to significant reductions in systolic and systolic blood pressure truong. This also led to a reduction in oxidation product levels in blood samples, demonstrating a reduction in oxidative reactions in the body.<br>
In other words, garlic extract supplementation reduces high cholesterol levels as well as blood pressure in hypertensive patients. The scientists added that this was a small study and more work needs to be done.
A 2019 review notes that allicin found in garlic may limit the production of angiotensin II, a hormone that increases blood pressure. It can also relax your blood vessels, allowing blood to flow more easily.<br>
<div></div><br>
4. Garlic is very nutritious but contains very few calories.<br>
Garlic is low in calories and rich in vitamin C, vitamin B6 and manganese. It also contains traces of many other nutrients.
One clove (about 3 grams) contains 4.5 calories, 0.2 grams of protein and 1 gram of carbohydrates.<br>
Garlic is a good source of many nutrients, including selenium and fiber
Garlic also contains small amounts of other nutrients.<br>
<div></div><br>
5. Boosts immunity<br>
Garlic protects against free radicals and prevents DNA damage. Zinc contained in garlic helps strengthen immunity. Vitamin C helps fight infections. It is very beneficial for fighting eye and ear infections because it has antibacterial properties.<br>
<div></div><br>
6. Improve skin health<br>
Garlic helps prevent acne and fade acne scars. Cold sores, psoriasis, rashes and blisters can all benefit from applying garlic juice. It also protects against UV rays and thus prevents aging.<br>
<div></div><br>
7. Improves digestion<br>
Digestive problems improve when raw garlic is included in the diet. It is beneficial for the intestines and reduces inflammation. Eating raw garlic helps eliminate intestinal worms. The advantage is that it kills harmful bacteria and protects beneficial bacteria in the intestines.<br>
<div></div><br>
8. Balances blood sugar levels<br>
People with diabetes should monitor their blood sugar levels by regulating their consumption of raw garlic.<br>
<div></div><br>
9. Garlic improves cholesterol levels, which may reduce the risk of heart disease.<br>
A 2018 research review found that garlic may reduce total and LDL (bad) cholesterol. The authors recommend that people with high cholesterol eat more garlic, but note that more research is needed to verify their results.<br>
According to a 2016 study, garlic supplementation over 2 months can reduce your LDL levels by up to 10%. Researchers noted this effect in people with mildly increased cholesterol levels.<br>
<div></div><br>
10. Garlic contains antioxidants that may help prevent Alzheimer's disease and dementia.<br>
Garlic supports brain health through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.<br>
It contains antioxidants that support your body's defense mechanisms against oxidative damage. Research shows that these antioxidants can significantly reduce oxidative stress and reduce the risk of related diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia.
Animal studies show that allicin in garlic may also help protect against cognitive decline.<br>
<div></div><br>
11. Garlic supplements may improve your athletic performance.<br>
Garlic is considered one of the best “performance enhancers”. Previously, this item was used to treat fatigue and improve workers' working capacity.<br>
Ancient civilizations used garlic to reduce fatigue and improve workers' productivity. Ancient Greek Olympic athletes consumed garlic to improve their performance.<br>
Rodent studies show that garlic consumption improves physical performance. People with heart disease who ate garlic for 6 weeks reduced their heart rate by 12% and improved their ability to exercise.<br>
<div></div><br>
12. Eating garlic can help detoxify heavy metals in the body.<br>
At high doses, sulfur compounds in garlic have been shown to protect against organ damage caused by heavy metal poisoning.
The allicin in garlic can help reduce the amount of lead in your blood and vital organs.<br>
A 2012 study of employees at an auto battery factory (who were overexposed to lead) found that garlic reduced blood lead levels by 19%. It also reduces many clinical signs of toxicity, including headaches and high blood pressure.
Three doses of garlic a day are even better than D-penicillamine in reducing symptoms.<br>
<div></div><br>
13. Garlic can improve bone health.<br>
Consuming garlic in your regular diet may also help prevent or reduce the onset of osteoarthritis. Research has shown that garlic contains a compound called diallyl disulfide which helps maintain bone density and therefore has the potential to delay the onset of bone diseases such as osteoarthritis.
Several recent studies have measured the effects of garlic on bone health, especially in postmenopausal women. One study found that women whose diets were rich in allium vegetables had lower levels of osteoarthritis. Examples of allium vegetables include garlic, leeks, chives, onions and rakkyo.<br>
The study authors say their results not only highlight the possible impact of diet on osteoarthritis outcomes but also demonstrate the potential for using compounds found in garlic to develop treatments against this disease.
Long-term study, including more than 1,000 healthy twins, shows that people who eat more fruits and vegetables, "especially onions like garlic" have fewer signs of early osteoarthritis than in the hip joint.<br>
Results of a clinical trial published in 2017 show that garlic can reduce oxidative stress that leads to osteoporosis. 
A 2018 study found that 12 weeks of garlic supplementation (1 gram per day) reduced pain in women with knee osteoarthritis and who were obese or overweight.<br>
<div></div><br>
14. Prevents cancer and stomach ulcers<br>
Thanks to its high antioxidant content, garlic protects the body against lung, prostate, bladder, stomach, liver and colon cancers. The antibacterial effect of garlic prevents stomach ulcers as it helps eliminate infection from the intestines.<br>
<div></div><br>
15. Good for weight loss<br>
Garlic reduces the expression of genes responsible for the formation of fat-storing fat cells. It also increases thermogenesis in the body and leads to more fat burning and reduced LDL (bad cholesterol).<br>
In addition to being good for weight loss, garlic is also very nutritious. In fact, a clove of raw garlic, weighing about 3 grams, contains: Manganese, vitamin B6, vitamin C, selenium, fiber, calcium, copper, potassium, iron, etc.<br>
<div></div><br>
16. Fights urinary tract infections and improves kidneys. <br>
Fresh garlic juice has the ability to reduce the growth of E. Coli bacteria that cause urinary tract infections (UTIs). It also helps prevent kidney infections.<br>
Garlic reduces wound infections, promotes hair growth, bone and liver health. Most home remedies are only effective if garlic is eaten raw.<br>
<div></div><br>
17. Reduces fatigue during exercise<br>
According to Japanese research, raw garlic incubated in a mixture of water and wine can have a significant effect on physical endurance. Human studies have also been conducted and show that garlic can actually improve symptoms of exercise-related fatigue.<br>
<div></div><br>
18. Reduce blood toxicity<br>
For people at risk of lead poisoning due to occupational accidents, garlic may be the best organic solution. Studies conducted in 2012 showed that garlic is actually safer and more effective in reducing lead poisoning in the blood than d-penicillamine, the drug commonly used to treat this problem.<br>
<div></div><br>
19. Overcoming Estrogen Deficiency<br>
Menopause in older women is often associated with a lack of a female hormone called estrogen due to irregular production of a protein called cytokine. It has been observed that consumption of garlic can regulate this phenomenon to some extent and thus may be effective in overcoming postmenopausal estrogen deficiency.<br>
<div></div><br>
20. Prevents heart blockages<br>
Garlic is also said to help reduce the stickiness of platelets in your blood. These platelets are responsible for blood clotting. Consuming healthy amounts of garlic can help reduce the excessive clotting effect of platelets on the blood. Therefore, it can help prevent unnecessary blood clots from forming in the arteries that could reach the heart and cause a heart attack.</div>

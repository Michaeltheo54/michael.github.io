							<div id="two">Moringa oleifera is a plant with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Its health benefits can range from speeding up wound healing to controlling blood sugar levels.

Also known as drumstick tree, miracle tree, ben oil tree or horseradish tree, people have used moringa for centuries for its health benefits.<br>
Moringa leaves provide a rich source of nutrients and have anti-inflammatory properties. Their antioxidant properties combined with their cell health-protecting properties make them a new “superfood.” They block the production of inflammatory enzymes and reduce sugar levels.<br>
<div></div><br>
1. Rich in vitamins and minerals<br>
Moringa leaves are rich in vitamins A, C, B1 (thiamine), B2 (riboflavin), B3 (niacin), B6 ​​​and folate . They are also rich in magnesium, iron, calcium, phosphorus and zinc.<br>
<div></div><br>
2. Rich in amino acids<br>
Moringa leaves are rich in amino acids, which are components of protein. There are 18 types of amino acids and each makes an important contribution to our health.<br>
<div></div><br>
3. Rich in Antioxidants<br>
Moringa leaves have antioxidant properties and protect against the harmful effects of free radicals found in the environment. Free radical damage is the cause of many chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart problems and Alzheimer's disease.
Moringa leaves are rich in vitamin C and beta-carotene that fight free radicals.<br>
They also contain quercetin, an antioxidant that helps lower blood pressure. Another antioxidant found in moringa leaves is chlorogenic acid, which helps stabilize blood sugar levels after meals.
A study in women found that regularly taking 1.5 teaspoons of Moringa leaf powder for three months significantly increased antioxidant levels in the blood.<br>
<div></div><br>
4. Anti-Inflammation<br>
Inflammation is the body's natural way of responding to pain and injury. Moringa leaves have anti-inflammatory properties due to the presence of isothiocyanates. They contain niazimicin, which is known to control the growth of cancer cells. Inflammation is the cause of many diseases such as cancer, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and many autoimmune diseases. When we suffer an injury or infection, the body becomes more inflamed.
Moringa is high in antioxidants and anti-inflammatories, such as quercetin, which may help protect heart health. Quercetin may help prevent lipid formation and inflammation, both of which can contribute to heart disease.<br>
It is essentially a defense mechanism against injury, but due to poor lifestyle and unhealthy diet, inflammation can increase in the body. Long-term inflammation leads to chronic health problems. Eating Moringa leaves helps reduce inflammation.<br>
<div></div><br>
5. Reduces blood sugar levels<br>
Prolonged high blood sugar levels lead to the development of diabetes in individuals. Conversely, diabetes can cause heart problems and organ damage. To avoid this, it is good to control blood sugar levels. Moringa leaves are a perfect resource for this as they stabilize blood sugar levels thanks to the presence of isothiocyanates.
Moringa leaf extract may benefit people with diabetes, including helping to control blood sugar and insulin levels and protecting against organ damage. Its properties may help prevent complications and slow the progression of the disease.<br>
<div></div><br>
6. Lowers cholesterol<br>
Besides oats, flaxseeds and almonds, moringa leaves are a reliable remedy for high cholesterol. Cholesterol is the main cause of heart disease and consuming moringa leaves has been shown to be effective against high cholesterol levels. Moringa oleifera may reduce these levels and protect against the risk of heart disease. Pregnant women often have higher cholesterol levels, which may increase the risk of developing gestational diabetes during pregnancy. What is gestational diabetes? This type of diabetes was first discovered in pregnant women who did not have diabetes before becoming pregnant. Moringa leaves can definitely be included in a gestational diabetes diet.<br>
<div></div><br>
7. Good for the stomach<br>
Moringa leaves are effective against digestive disorders. People suffering from constipation, bloating, flatulence, gastritis and ulcerative colitis should add moringa leaves to their diet.
The leaves have antibiotic and antibacterial properties that make them an ideal remedy for digestive disorders. Even the high amount of vitamin B in the leaves helps improve digestion.<br>
In one study, moringa reduced stomach acid by about 85%, suggesting it may prevent stomach ulcers.<br>
<div></div><br>
8. Improves bone health<br>
Moringa leaves are a rich source of calcium and phosphorus. Both of these are necessary for good bone health. Because Moringa leaves have anti-inflammatory properties, they help fight arthritis and can even heal damaged bones. According to the authors of a rodent study, moringa extract has anti-inflammatory properties that may help prevent rheumatoid arthritis.
Moringa oleifera also fights osteoporosis and keeps bones and teeth strong.<br>

They are also suitable for acne-prone skin. This is why moringa leaves are used in many cosmetics. They improve the skin and add radiance thanks to its purifying properties and therapeutic properties.
Research involving animals has suggested that moringa seed oil may help skin wounds heal faster. One way to do this is to reduce oxidative stress.<br>
<div></div><br>
10. Protects the liver<br>
Moringa may help protect the liver against liver disease.
The liver is the site of blood detoxification, fat metabolism and nutrient absorption and can only function normally if liver enzymes are normal. Moringa leaves stabilize these liver enzymes.<br>
People suffering from tuberculosis can greatly benefit from moringa leaves as it reduces the negative effects of anti-tuberculosis drugs. Leaves accelerate the repair process of liver cells. The leaves have high concentrations of polyphenols that help protect against and may even reduce oxidative liver damage. They increase protein levels in the liver.<br>

11. Improves Eye Health<br>
Moringa contains the antioxidant beta-carotene, which is essential for maintaining eye health and preventing eye diseases.<br>
<div></div><br>
12. Protection against arsenic toxicity<br>
In many parts of the world, arsenic contamination is a common problem. Arsenic has entered our system through many food products, especially rice.
Long-term exposure to this element can lead to the development of cancer and heart disease. Research on laboratory animals has shown that moringa leaves counteract the effects of arsenic toxicity.<br>
<div></div><br>
13. Antiseptic<br>
Moringa leaves have an antiseptic effect and fight many bacterial infections. They are even beneficial for wound healing and help heal bruises, minor cuts, and burns quickly because they reduce blood clotting time.
Additionally, moringa contains substances that may fight certain food-borne pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli), research shows.<br>

16. Good for the nervous system<br>
Moringa's antioxidant activity may protect against disorders that affect the nervous system, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease, neuropathic pain and depression. <br>

Scientists believe it may have neuroprotective properties, but they have not yet determined how they work.<br>
Many neurological disorders have shown positive results using moringa leaves. They support brain health and act as nerve boosters. High concentrations of vitamins E and C fight nerve cell degeneration and help improve brain function. People who suffer from migraines or recurrent headaches should eat moringa leaves regularly. These leaves also play a role in balancing mood as they stabilize the production of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine, which are important for memory, mood and response to stimuli.<br>
<div></div><br>

18. Treatment of edema<br>
Edema occurs when fluid accumulates in body tissues, for example due to inflammation. Ear edema can cause swelling of the tissues around the ear, usually due to infection.
In one study, administration of moringa seed oil reduced skin inflammation in rats with edema. This suggests that moringa's anti-inflammatory properties may help treat ear edema, although more research is needed.<br>
<div></div><br>
19. Preventing and Treating Cancer<br>
Moringa contains properties that may help prevent cancer. For example, it contains niazimicin, a compound that inhibits the growth of cancer cells.
According to some scientists, extracts from the leaves, bark and other parts of the Moringa tree may have cancer-killing properties. If further research confirms, they may be useful in treating breast, liver, colorectal, and other cancers.<br>
<div></div><br>

Football's long and flourishing history has seen many records set and broken. Many of these incredible records seem almost impossible to break in the future.
You may have never heard of some of them, but by reading this article you will get to know about them.<br>
<div></div><br>
1. Most goals scored in a single World Cup<br>
Harry Kane won the Golden Boot of the 2018 World Cup by scoring an impressive 6 goals.
His achievements were impressive and played a key role in the national team's fourth-place finish. However, it turns out that Kane's performance in Russia was far from a record.<br>
The honor of scoring the most goals at the World Cup goes to French player Just Fontaine.
The French striker scored 13 goals in 6 matches to help France place 3rd at the 1958 FIFA World Cup.<br>

<div></div><br>
2. Almost no goals conceded for the country<br>
This amazing football record is held by Dino Zoff.
The Italian legend is famous for stopping attackers before they smell a goal. It's a shame we can't see him playing against Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi these days.<br>
However, Zoff is one of the greatest goalkeepers in history and once held the Serie A record for most consecutive clean sheets. But Gianluigi Buffon broke this record in the 2015/16 season when he went 12 matches and 974 consecutive minutes without conceding a goal.
However, Buffon was never able to surpass Zoff's record of 1,142 minutes without conceding a goal for Italy.<br>
<div></div><br>

3. Record of winning 5 consecutive European Cups<br>
The 1950s-60s was the period of Real Madrid's dominance in Europe when for 5 consecutive years, from 1955 to 1960, they won the champions league cup 5 times. This incredible feat brought Real Madrid into the top of the world's biggest clubs.
Nowadays, winning the champions league is very difficult and no team has ever won this prestigious European trophy two times in a row.<br>
Real Madrid won three consecutive Champions League titles between 2016 and 2018.
It sounds impressive, but it turns out there was once an even more formidable Los Blancos team. It's hard to imagine, but the team from 1955 to 1960 was something else.<br>
Real Madrid have won five consecutive European Cups, led by the legendary Alfredo Di Stefano.<br>
<div></div><br>
4. Fastest goal in a World Cup match<br>
That special honor belongs to Hakan Sukur.
The Turkish striker took just 10.89 seconds to score against South Korea in the third place match at the 2002 World Cup.
The previous record holder was Vaclav Masek, who took 15 seconds to score for Czechoslovakia Carved against Mexico in 1962.<br>
<div></div><br>
5. Most goals scored in a single season in Europe<br>
Gerd Muller's old record of 67 goals in the 1972/73 season is said to still be unbeatable. Since then, no one has come close to it.
But with that, Lionel Messi, nicknamed “The Magician”, appeared to achieve the impossible for Barcelona. How he did this is still beyond our imagination, it's what we expect from video games, not real life.<br>
But Messi proved us wrong in the 2012/13 season when he scored 73 goals for Barcelona. Nothing could stop him from crushing European defenses that season.
He set a brand new record of 91 goals in a calendar year.<br>
<div></div><br>
6. Goalkeeper with the most goals<br>
There are goalkeepers who can do more than keep the ball out of their own net. In fact, some decide to do better by scoring goals for their team.
The goalkeeper position is considered almost impossible to score goals in but there are sometimes exceptions. 131 goals may be a relatively normal number for a striker, but if scored by a goalkeeper, it is an impressive record. The current holder of this record is Rogerio Ceni, goalkeeper of Sao Paulo Club (Brazil).<br>
The veteran star has played 1250 matches, scored 131 goals and even though he is 42 years old, Ceni is still the top choice of Sao Paulo Club. Perhaps there will never be a goalkeeper with the ability to score as strange as Rogerio Ceni in his career.
The Sao Paulo legend scored an incredible 131 goals in his career, while his closest rival José Luis Chilavert finished with 67 goals.<br>
<div></div><br>
7. Player with the most goals<br>
Although Messi and Ronaldo are currently considered two "destructive scoring machines", compared to their previous seniors, the achievements of the two superstars are indeed very low compared to the legendary striker Josef Bican scored a total of 1468 goals as a professional football player and holds the record as the world's highest goal scorer.<br>
In modern football, it is very difficult for players to break this record because today's football rules have become more strict.<br>
<div></div><br>
8. Number of people watching a football match<br>
The 1950 World Cup final between Brazil and Uruguay at Maracana Stadium currently holds the record for the largest number of spectators in history, with about 210,000 spectators watching at the stadium.
At that time, Brazil and Uruguay were two great rivals in world football, so every match between the two teams was very attractive.<br>
Although only 173,850 tickets were sold, the number of people coming to Maracana Stadium was so large that the match was seriously threatened by the risk of disruption. After 1950, football officials increased stadium security to ensure high security for every match.<br>
<div></div><br>
9. Highest scoring match<br>
The match between AS Adema and O l'Emyrne took place on October 31, 2002 within the framework of the Madagascar national championship and ended with a score of 149-0 in favor of the local team. 
This match scored the most goals in world football history and was recognized by the Guinness Book of Records.<br>
However, multiple mysterious decisions against Emmy led to Adema's championship win, so the team decided to lose each other in protest. They scored 149 goals against their team. With such frequency, they score a goal every 40 seconds.<br>
<div></div><br>
10. Record for scoring the fewest goals in the Premier League<br>
This sad record was set by Derby County in the 2007/08 season. After 38 rounds, Derby County only won 1 goal against Newcastle, while their number of losses reached 29 (also a British record).
At the end of the season, Derby County ended the season in last place on the rankings with 11 points, scored 20 goals and had 89 goals scored by their opponents.<br>
<div></div><br>
11. Record for the most matches in a career<br>
People still mistakenly believe that the legendary Pelé with 1375 matches in his career will hold the record for the most matches in the world, but in reality, No. The actual number of Pele's matches is only 1,115 official matches.
Pele's performance is far worse than Rogerio Ceni's when this 42-year-old goalkeeper has played 1,250 matches in his career.<br>
<div></div><br>
12. Top scorer of the national team<br>
Former Iranian player Ali Daei set an unprecedented record when scoring 103 goals/149 matches after 13 years with the national team. He is far ahead of Hungarian Ferenc Puskas, who is second with 84 goals/85 matches.
During his playing career, the 45-year-old former striker played for Bayern Munich in the 1998-1999 season, winning the Bundesliga championship and runner-up in the Champions League. The only player capable of matching Daei is Ireland's Robbie Keane, who has scored 65 goals for Ireland.<br>
<div></div><br>
13. The player who scored the most goals in a World Cup season<br>
In recent World Cups, the players who scored the most goals usually did not score more than 7 goals. Therefore, if there are seven goals at this prestigious playground, the player can receive the prestigious Golden Shoe.
However, during the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, striker Just Fontaine scored 13 goals for the French football team. This step is very difficult to do in the future.<br>
<div></div><br>

14. Four goals per game in four consecutive games (Nakayama)<br>
That's a record you'd probably expect Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi to have.<br>
But this goal belongs to Japanese football player Masashi Nakayama, who scored 16 goals in 4 consecutive matches. It all took place in the J1 League but it's still an impressive record.
Nakayama achieved this feat between 15 and 21 April 1998 with Japanese club Júbilo Iwata.<br>
<div></div><br>
15. Most titles won in one year (Barcelona)<br>
Pep Guardiola's four years at Barcelona were incredible, with his first two seasons being the best of his career.
The Catalan player won La Liga, Copa del Rey and UEFA Champions League in the 2008/09 season. The Spanish Super Cup and European Super Cup followed in 2009 before Barcelona won the FIFA Club World Cup.<br>
So they won an incredible six trophies.
Since then, no one has come close to breaking this record.<br>
